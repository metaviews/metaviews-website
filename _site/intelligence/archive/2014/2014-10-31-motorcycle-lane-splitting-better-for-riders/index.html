  <div class="prose"><p><a href="http://www.gizmag.com/motorcycle-lane-splitting-filtering-safety-research/34425/">Motorcycle lane splitting: Better for riders, better for drivers, and safer than sitting in traffic</a>&gt; Recent research has confirmed what many motorcycle riders have known for years. “Lane splitting” – or riding in between lanes of traffic – obviously saves riders a lot of time, but it’s also considerably safer than sitting in traffic and acting like a car, as long as it’s done within certain guidelines, and contrary to what many drivers think, it actually speeds up traffic for everyone else on the road.</p><p>Riders, please pass this information on to the drivers in your lives.</p><p>PDF of “<a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/transportation/article3210060.ece/binary/California%20Lane%20Splitting%20Crash%20Analysis.pdf">Safety implications of lane-splitting among California motorcyclists involved in collisions</a>”</p>
