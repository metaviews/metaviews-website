  <div class="prose"><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3qXjG4mzSQJesse Hirsh, host of 3D Dialogue, interviews Professor Ursula Franklin regarding her latest book, The Ursula Franklin Reader: Pacifism as a Map.</p><p>Dr.</p><p>Franklin is a distinguished author, scientist, feminist, activist, and Quaker, who has written extensively on the role of technology in society.</p><p>In this interview, we deal with the rise of techno-fascism and the need for feminism and social justice in drafting a map for us to use in moving towards a society of peace, instead of one based on war.</p><p>Dr.</p><p>Franklin is frail, and her voice soft, yet this interview is worth watching, as her ideas are sharp, her criticism cutting, and listening to her inspires action, so please share this discussion with your friends and colleagues.(Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">https://www.youtube.com/</a>)</p>
