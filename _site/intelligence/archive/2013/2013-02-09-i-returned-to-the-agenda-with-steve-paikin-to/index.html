  <div class="prose"><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CllLWk0fcHgI returned to <a href="http://ww3.tvo.org/video/188042/jesse-hirsh-blackberrys-odd-future">The Agenda with Steve Paikin to discuss the pivot that BlackBerry hopes to make</a> with the release of their new BB10 operating system.</p><p>We touched upon the new operating system, the Z10 device, and the challenges BlackBerry faces moving forward.</p><p>I enjoy going on The Agenda and talking with Steve as there are no commercials and the long conversational format allows for a smarter and deeper discussion.</p><p>For example we were able to get into the mythology that technology companies tend to foster and the impact this has upon their success.</p><p>This episode was shot during a massive snow storm in Toronto (and most of the North East of the continent), and the subway shut down three times while I was going to and from the studio.</p><p>The Agenda has another panel set for the show but had to cancel it because the participants couldn’t make it due to the snow.</p><p>Goes to show that often just showing up is enough to get in on the action, although it doesn’t help if you say smart stuff too(Source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">https://www.youtube.com/</a>)</p>
