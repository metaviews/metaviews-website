<p>Hey friends! We're back!</p>
<p>Episode 16: Resurgence</p>
<p>After a long hiatus, Metaviews to the Future returns with a renewed sense of purpose. In this special episode, we reflect on the journey of Metaviews so far—its origins, milestones, and the critical conversations that have defined our work.</p>
<p>This moment of resurgence marks the beginning of a new chapter, as we double down on our mission to envision a future of authority that serves everyone. Against the backdrop of rising authoritarianism, we explore how to look beyond its grip, toward its eventual collapse and failure. What does it take to build systems of power rooted in wisdom, nature, and participation?</p>
<p>Join us as we examine the past, embrace the present, and chart a course for a more just and funky future. The stakes couldn’t be higher, and the conversation starts here.</p>
