<h1>Intelligence</h1>

<p>
  Intelligence at Metaviews is about perspective. The name itself is a method:
  *meta-views*. We focus on connecting signals across domains—media, technology,
  politics, agriculture, culture—to reveal patterns that are otherwise missed
  when issues are treated in isolation. This work helps clients and partners see
  the larger system they are operating within, anticipate discontinuities, and
  recognize opportunities that remain invisible to those locked into
  conventional frames.
</p>

<p>
  The intelligence collected here takes many forms. Some briefs originate as
  professional analysis written for decision-makers. Others are deliberately
  provocative, designed to disrupt complacent thinking. Many were first
  published through our Substack; others come from earlier eras of Metaviews’
  work, rescued from platforms that no longer exist but whose insights remain
  relevant. Together, they form a living archive rather than a chronological
  feed.
</p>

<p>
  This archive serves two purposes. First, it supports active sense-making in
  the present—helping organizations navigate uncertainty, risk, and
  transformation. Second, it leaves a trail for future generations: a record of
  how power, technology, and culture were understood while they were still
  forming, not after they had hardened into history.
</p>

<p>
  Here we take seriously Marshall McLuhan’s idea of *counter-environments*:
  frameworks that allow us to perceive the present moment while we are still
  inside it. Intelligence, in this sense, is not prediction. It is the
  disciplined practice of making the invisible visible—so the present can be
  grasped before it disappears into the rearview mirror.
