<h1>Welcome to Metaviews</h1>

<p>
  We're in the process of updating our website for 2026. Testing out new
  technology for turbulent times.
</p>

<h2>What's New:</h2>
<h3><a href="https://thefutureherd.ca">The Future Herd</a></h3>

<p>
  A new podcast from Metaviews focused on the future of our agri-food system.
  <a href="https://thefutureherd.ca">The Future Herd</a> is built around
  conversations with leaders, practitioners, and decision-makers working across
  agriculture, policy, research, and innovation. The show treats the future not
  as a forecast, but as a shared coordination problem—one that demands
  collaboration, experimentation, and collective sense-making. Each episode
  explores how we adapt together, revealing the real pressures, trade-offs, and
  opportunities shaping food systems in real time.
