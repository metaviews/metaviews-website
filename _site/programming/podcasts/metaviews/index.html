      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;In this episode, Jesse Hirsh explores how Ontario can lead the next era of agri-food innovation through openness, foresight, and resilience. Drawing on his keynote for the Agri-Food 2050 event, he argues that disruption is no longer a storm to weather but the environment we live in — and that trust, literacy, and community are our most vital infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From AI and automation to open source collaboration and microbial intelligence, Jesse outlines a vision for a food system that learns, adapts, and regenerates. One rooted in shared stewardship, entrepreneurial literacy, and a public commitment to designing systems worthy of the people who depend on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key themes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foresight • AI &amp;amp; automation • Open source • Data integration • Trust • Literacy • Fermentation • Resilience&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;In this Metaviews salon, our motley crew dove deep into the wild and wondrous terrain of language—its power, its peril, and its paradoxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We summoned thinkers like George Lakoff, Noam Chomsky, and Walter Ong to help frame the discussion, but as always, the most revelatory insights emerged from the collective intelligence of the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We debated the boundaries of language—do animals possess it, or merely the shadows of it? Many argued convincingly that they do, challenging long-held anthropocentric assumptions. Language, after all, may not be exclusive to humans, even if its structures differ across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also wrestled with the viral nature of language: its ability to spread, mutate, and infect. Language is a force that inhabits us as much as we wield it—shaping perception, encoding power, and scaffolding our understanding of reality. It is both deeply social and intensely contextual, shifting meaning depending on time, place, and speaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world of proliferating dialects and splintered platforms, we noted how common meaning feels increasingly rare. Language is flourishing in diversity, yet fragmented in cohesion. Are we losing the ability to understand each other even as we gain new ways to express ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was, once again, a brilliant gathering—part provocation, part poetry. The Metaviews salon continues to prove that spontaneous conversation, when anchored in curiosity and care, can illuminate what formal discourse often obscures.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh introduces the season 3 premiere of Metaviews with a compelling discussion about the intricate concept of &quot;the nature of nature.&quot; The episode delves into how the term &quot;nature&quot; has become a catch-all reference point in discussions that often intertwine with politics and morality, leading to a paradoxical relationship with the environment—a relationship that is becoming increasingly urgent in light of climate change. The participants, a diverse group of insightful thinkers, explore the implications of our understanding of nature, questioning whether our perceptions and classifications truly reflect its essence or merely serve our human narratives. As they engage in lively banter, they touch on the idea that our interpretations of nature are often filtered through cultural lenses, which complicates our interaction with the world around us. This episode promises to challenge listeners to reconsider their connection to nature and the frameworks through which they view it, all while maintaining a light-hearted, witty tone throughout the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The podcast explores the complex relationship between humans and nature, emphasizing how our perceptions shape our understanding of what nature truly is. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Listeners are encouraged to consider how cultural perspectives influence our interpretations of nature, highlighting the importance of indigenous knowledge in understanding ecological systems. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; A recurring theme is the paradox of human control over nature versus the inherent unpredictability of natural systems, as demonstrated by the responses of various species to environmental changes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The discussion delves into the implications of language in defining our relationship with nature, suggesting that our linguistic constructs can often obscure the innate interconnectedness of all living things. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;In the final episode of Season 2, Metaviews pauses to reflect—on where &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;we’ve been, where we are, and where we’re going. Titled Chrysalis, this &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;episode marks a moment of transformation. Season 2 was about finding our&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; rhythm, tuning our instruments, and building trust in spontaneous, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;serendipitous dialogue. Now, with Season 3 on the horizon, we prepare to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; lean in and accelerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We explore the transition from preparation to propulsion—from getting &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;into the groove to becoming something new entirely. But this is not a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;passive metamorphosis. It’s an intentional act of collective emergence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Season 3 will focus on the methodologies of our shared democratic &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;future—practical tools and frameworks for building systems that don’t &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;wait for regimes to fall or reform themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While our gaze remains future-oriented, we acknowledge the weight of the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; present. The crises are real. The moment is dire. But transformation is&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; not just possible—it’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;In an insightful episode of Metaviews, Jesse Hirsh engages Ted Whetstone in a thought-provoking conversation that meanders through personal anecdotes, societal critiques, and philosophical musings. Jesse begins by sharing his unique ritual of goat walking, describing it as a form of spiritual practice that brings him peace and clarity. This light-hearted introduction serves as a springboard for deeper reflections on autonomy and the lessons that nature can impart about human existence. It sets a tone that is both contemplative and whimsical, inviting listeners to ponder their own relationships with the natural world and the simplicity of joyful exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion quickly evolves as Ted introduces the complexities of the current political landscape in Los Angeles, touching on the intricate interplay of civil, military, and federal narratives. He articulates the challenges of understanding these competing conversations, emphasizing the need for multi-dimensional perspectives in navigating today&#39;s socio-political milieu. Ted&#39;s insights into media literacy and the importance of diverse narratives challenge listeners to engage critically with the information they consume, urging them to resist binary thinking that simplifies the rich tapestry of human experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the episode progresses, the dialogue shifts to encompass broader themes of transformation and the potential for societal change. Ted expresses an idealistic vision of the future, advocating for a collective understanding of resilience that transcends authoritarianism. Their metaphorical exploration culminates in a discussion of the caterpillar&#39;s metamorphosis into a butterfly, symbolizing the potential for growth and renewal. This rich tapestry of conversation not only encourages listeners to reflect on their own journeys but also inspires them to embrace complexity and creativity in addressing the challenges of the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh and Jeremiah Patterson engage in an insightful dialogue that delves deep into the intricacies of news, attention, and power dynamics in contemporary society. The episode unfolds with Hirsh&#39;s reflections on the spontaneous nature of their conversations, setting the stage for an exploration of significant current events. They tackle the serious topic of regulatory agencies being undermined by political maneuvers, drawing parallels to historical attacks on institutional integrity, such as the McCarthy era. Patterson articulates how these developments not only threaten democracy but also reshape the very fabric of public trust in government institutions, posing long-lasting ramifications for society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the discussion progresses, Patterson shares his personal journey as an independent journalist, highlighting the pressures and ethical considerations that come with the territory. He grapples with the challenge of selecting which narratives to prioritize, caught between audience expectations and his own journalistic convictions. The interplay between these competing interests is palpable as he reflects on the responsibility he feels to both inform and engage his audience. Hirsh&#39;s probing questions facilitate a rich exchange, allowing Patterson to articulate the dilemmas faced by many in the media today, emphasizing the need for thoughtful curation of stories in an age saturated with information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation then pivots to the critical role of local journalism in fostering community resilience and combating misinformation. Patterson highlights various grassroots movements and underreported stories that exemplify the power of local activism in effecting change. Their witty banter interspersed with serious reflections culminates in a powerful message: the necessity for individuals to stay informed, engaged, and proactive in their communities. The episode concludes with a call to action, encouraging listeners to recognize the importance of their voices in a democratic society and the essential role they play in supporting a free press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jesse Hirsh emphasizes the importance of spontaneous conversations in journalism, allowing for improvisation and emotional analysis of current news events. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jeremiah Patterson highlights the alarming trend of regulatory sabotage in U.S. agencies, likening it to historical attacks on institutions rather than individuals. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Both speakers discuss the overwhelming speed of news cycles today, where crucial stories can be overshadowed by a deluge of less significant news. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The podcast addresses the critical role of local journalism in holding power accountable and the dangers posed by the erosion of local news outlets. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jeremiah urges listeners to remain vigilant about local elections, as grassroots resistance is vital in countering political corruption and misinformation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation culminates in a call to action, encouraging young people to engage in politics and consider running for office to effect change. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links referenced in this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://substack.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;substack.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://propublica.org&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;propublica.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theintercept.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;theintercept.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;newrepublic.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

The trio explores the nuances surrounding the recent news of a flight attendant implicated in a significant drug trafficking bust, sparking conversations about the broader implications of individual actions within systemic issues. As they navigate through various topics, they highlight the importance of transparency and accountability within the food supply chain, emphasizing that the perception of food quality is often muddled by corporate agendas. Hirsch, Oppenheim, and McOrmond also reflect on the future of education and community support, suggesting a need for a more integrative approach to learning that includes nourishment and wellness as core components. Their witty banter underscores not only the seriousness of these topics but also the necessity of fostering inclusive dialogues as they contemplate potential futures amidst current societal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The podcast emphasizes the importance of community and collective action in addressing systemic issues rather than relying solely on individual efforts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jesse Hirsh, Mike Oppenheim, and Russell McOrmond engage in a dynamic discussion about the complexities of the food system, including the implications of disinformation and food safety. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mike raises intriguing points about the motivations behind drug trafficking, linking it to broader societal issues such as poverty and systemic injustice. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Russell underscores the need for a shift in how we understand responsibility, advocating for a more nuanced view that considers systemic factors over individual blame. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation highlights the tension between personal and systemic approaches to societal issues, particularly in the context of education and community support systems. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Through witty banter, the trio explores the future of food production and social policy, suggesting that a collective reimagining of these systems is essential for sustainable change. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;In this episode of Metaviews, Jesse Hirsh is joined by technologist and thinker Russell McOrmand for a wide-ranging conversation that dismantles the myth of &quot;human nature&quot; and exposes the lingering shadows of eugenics in modern institutions. Together, they explore how corporate culture has infested political discourse, reducing democracy to a sport and sidelining long-term thinking in favor of short-term spectacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would it mean to think seven generations ahead? What role could neurodivergent individuals play in building better futures? And how might we imagine a news service designed by and for neurodivergent people—one that prioritizes clarity, complexity, and care over clickbait?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From systemic critique to visionary alternatives, this episode offers a radical reframing of where we are—and where we could go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russell&#39;s shout out: https://daanis.ca/becoming-kin2/&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;In this mind-bending episode of &lt;em&gt;Metaviews&lt;/em&gt;, Jesse Hirsh reconnects with resident Radical American Whackadoo, Mike Oppenheim, for an unscripted exploration of belief, hope, agency, and the beautiful chaos of human connection. Together they pull at the threads of how emotions drive our actions, how messing with people’s minds can be an act of love, and why politics keeps obsessing over a mythical &quot;centre&quot; that doesn&#39;t actually exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking inspiration from herds—where movement is constant and no one stays in the middle for long—Mike and Jesse challenge the framing of &quot;extremism,&quot; reframing it as natural diversity of agendas. They advocate for a return to bottom-up mutual respect, the kind that George Carlin might have described as both blunt and deeply compassionate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a free-range conversation designed to unsettle, inspire, and maybe make you laugh at the absurdity of it all.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;In this episode of &lt;em&gt;Metaviews&lt;/em&gt;, host Jesse Hirsh welcomes back Laura Brekelmans—our resident Goddess of Chaos, Complexity, and Contradiction—for a conversation that refuses to resolve neatly. Building on her previous appearance exploring the thought-worlds of Wittgenstein and McLuhan, this dialogue ventures deeper into the entangled relationships between language, meaning, technology, and the sacred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, Jesse and Laura explore the provocative question: what would a new religion for the digital age look like? One that doesn’t position nature and technology in opposition, but instead seeks to harmonize them. Along the way, they interrogate the limits of rationality, the necessity of myth, and the power of contradiction as a creative force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This episode is not about tidy answers—it’s about embracing the generative mess of complexity, the poetry of systems thinking, and the spiritual imperative to live in tension with our time.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

From backyard gardens to urban food forests, from mutual aid to microbial soil life, this dialogue connects personal action with planetary transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to cultivate revolution in the soil beneath our feet? How can urban agriculture rewire our relationship with land, labour, and local governance? And what role do education, resilience, and seed sovereignty play in reimagining our food systems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeanette and Greg share practical strategies and powerful stories from the front lines of the food sovereignty movement—challenging extractive models and offering hopeful alternatives rooted in care, community, and regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords:&lt;/strong&gt; food sovereignty, agroecology, urban farming, regenerative agriculture, seed saving, mutual aid, climate resilience, system change, gardening as resistance, local food systems&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;The conversation between Jesse Hirsh and Ted Whetstone unfolds in a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;relaxed yet intellectually stimulating atmosphere, marked by their witty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; exchanges and spontaneous dialogue. They address the elephant in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;room—American depression—against the backdrop of economic turmoil, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;exploring how news cycles influence public perception and individual &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;mental health. Ted brings to light the complexities of geopolitical &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;tensions, particularly in relation to tariffs on Chinese imports, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the impending decisions regarding TikTok, revealing the layers of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;societal impact that emerge from these policies. Jesse and Ted&#39;s &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;discourse is not merely a commentary on current events but an invitation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; to engage with the complexities of modern life, emphasizing the need &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;for a deeper understanding of our collective future. Their discussion &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;underscores the importance of fostering environments where diverse &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;voices can contribute meaningfully to the conversation, ultimately &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;advocating for a more inclusive approach to problem-solving in our &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;rapidly evolving world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jesse Hirsh and Ted Whetstone delve into the complexities of American &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;society, especially regarding the impact of economic and political &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;shifts on mental health, highlighting the pervasive nature of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The discussion emphasizes the importance of adaptability in navigating &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the ever-evolving landscape of information and societal values, where &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;yesterday&#39;s context won&#39;t suffice for today&#39;s challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hirsh expresses concern over the potential loss of popular platforms &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;like TikTok amid rising tariffs, indicating it could lead to significant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; cultural backlash from younger demographics who rely on such mediums &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;for expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Whetstone proposes that the future is a human-created phenomenon, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;suggesting that collective intelligence and diverse perspectives are &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;essential to navigate challenges ahead, especially in light of current &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;global tensions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The duo reflects on the role of empathy and vulnerability in fostering &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;understanding across diverse perspectives, advocating for a richer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;dialogue that embraces complexity and uncertainty in modern discourse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The conversation culminates in a call for open-source wisdom, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;underscoring the need for collaborative spaces where individuals can &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;freely share ideas and learn from one another, moving beyond &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;conventional narratives.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh and Mike Oppenheim delve into the looming specter of the next Great American Depression, framing their dialogue around the economic and societal implications of such an event. They begin by discussing the various news items that set the context for their conversation, noting the intersection of sports and politics as a reflection of larger economic trends. Hirsh critiques the recent contract signed by Vladimir Guerrero Jr. with the Toronto Blue Jays, suggesting it symbolizes deeper issues like cultural and economic anxieties felt by the public. Oppenheim counters with the idea that this contract may actually provide a sense of hope, as it indicates confidence in the team’s future amidst a backdrop of uncertainty. The two then pivot to discussing the societal impacts of a potential depression, exploring how collective sentiment and shared grievances might unite people in unexpected ways, perhaps through a common adversary. They highlight the importance of community and connection in times of crisis, suggesting that navigating such a depression could lead to a reevaluation of values and priorities, both individually and collectively. As the episode unfolds, they intertwine humor with serious commentary, making for a conversation that is both enlightening and engaging, ultimately leaving the listener to ponder the resilience of the human spirit in the face of economic adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jesse and Mike discuss the looming Great American Depression, emphasizing its potential effects on everyday life and the economy. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; They explore how rising tensions, trade wars, and political instability could contribute to economic downturns and societal unrest. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation highlights the importance of community and shared experiences during difficult times, as they believe togetherness can mitigate despair. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; They acknowledge the shifting landscape of American politics and culture, suggesting a need for empathy and understanding to navigate future challenges. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh engages in a thought-provoking conversation with Anna Melnikoff, the dimensional liaison at Metaviews, as they delve into the intricate realms of neurodivergence and the evolution of human consciousness. The episode kicks off with a sharp analysis of the impending labor shortage, linking it to broader socio-political dynamics while emphasizing that people are increasingly unwilling to endure subpar working conditions. Anna draws attention to the alarming rise of disinformation in Canadian politics, highlighting the role of bots and paid trolls, urging listeners to maintain awareness and not engage with such distractions. The dialogue then shifts to the significance of systemic thinking, particularly among women who are spearheading grassroots movements to reimagine societal structures for collective well-being. As they explore the intersections of neurodivergence and societal evolution, both Jesse and Anna bring a witty yet insightful lens to the discussion, making it clear that recognizing and embracing diverse perspectives is essential for creating a more equitable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Anna Melnikoff emphasizes the importance of recognizing disinformation campaigns, especially during election seasons, warning about the influence of paid trolls and bots. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The podcast discusses the need for greater emotional literacy and understanding among individuals, especially men, who often struggle with vulnerability and expression. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jesse and Anna explore how neurodivergent individuals might represent an evolutionary advancement in human consciousness, offering unique insights into systemic issues. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation highlights the significance of community building among diverse groups, especially in the context of women organizing for systemic change. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Anna notes that sensitivity, often seen as a weakness, is actually a superpower that can lead to deeper connections and understanding in society. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The discussion touches on how the current societal structures suppress emotional connections, calling for a shift towards embracing diverse emotional experiences. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

They delve into how external pressures, such as political dynamics and societal changes, challenge the very fabric of community and identity. The discourse oscillates between humor and serious reflection, with Hirsh and Oppenheim examining how these challenges manifest in their respective societies. Notably, they touch on the implications of the Trump administration&#39;s actions on legal firms and pro bono work, drawing parallels with broader issues of freedom of speech and the need for civic engagement. As they explore the nuances of these topics, the episode encourages listeners to reflect on the importance of community in fostering resilience amid chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jesse and Mike highlight the chaotic weather patterns in North America, reflecting on the existential crises of spring and winter, and how they mirror societal conflicts. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The podcast emphasizes the significance of community, immigration, and the evolving cultural landscape of North America amid political tensions and social unrest. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mike discusses the disturbing impact of the Trump administration on law firms, particularly regarding pro bono work and the intimidation of young lawyers committed to social justice. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation touches on the challenges of isolation, referencing a team of scientists in Antarctica, drawing parallels to potential future missions to Mars and the need for social resilience. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jesse critiques the current state of freedom of speech in America, noting a troubling silence among elites who should be voicing dissent against governmental actions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The episode culminates in a humorous yet serious debate on the hypothetical annexation of Canada by the U.S., exploring themes of identity, culture, and the implications of such a union. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;A fascinating exchange unfolds as host Jesse Hirsh invites Laura Brekelmans to engage in a lively discussion that spans the realms of biology, media, and politics. The episode opens with a light-hearted note about the dreary weather, setting the stage for a deep dive into the complexities of contemporary issues. Laura&#39;s reflections on the EU&#39;s military budget reveal her transformative journey from anti-war sentiment to recognizing the necessity of military preparedness in a rapidly changing world. Her candid and humorous recounting of this shift resonates with listeners, prompting them to consider how personal beliefs can evolve in response to external circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the conversation progresses, Laura and Jesse unpack the various ideologies that shape societal discourse, taking particular aim at neoliberalism and its shortcomings. Laura&#39;s insights on the need for Europe to bolster its military capabilities highlight the urgency of the current geopolitical climate while raising questions about dependency on American military power. The dialogue navigates the intricate balance between ideology and practical governance, encouraging listeners to reflect on the implications of military spending for democratic values and social cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The episode further transitions into a speculative discussion about the future of technology, where Laura introduces the concept of &#39;Dynamic Land&#39;, a revolutionary approach to computing that envisions technology as an integral part of communal life. This forward-thinking perspective challenges traditional notions of technology as a tool for isolation, instead proposing a model that fosters collaboration and connection. Laura&#39;s enthusiasm for this vision, coupled with her critical examination of current events, leaves the audience with a renewed sense of hope for the future, emphasizing the importance of understanding the interplay between biology, media, and society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Laura Brekelmans discusses the evolving relationship between European countries and their military spending, highlighting a significant shift in perspective towards defense. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation explores the potential of AI, emphasizing its role as a medium that reflects current technological trends rather than a definitive future solution. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jesse Hirsh and Laura Brekelmans delve into the philosophical implications of media and biology, suggesting that our understanding of language shapes our societal interactions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Laura presents the idea of &#39;Dynamic Land&#39;, a concept that reimagines computing in a communal setting, challenging traditional views of technology&#39;s role in society. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Both the host and guest agree that while authoritarian regimes may act quickly, they often fail to achieve sustainable progress in the face of global challenges. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The episode concludes with a focus on the importance of collaboration and diverse approaches in technology, echoing the necessity for a more interconnected and compassionate future. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;A deep dive into cultural anthropology unfolds as Jesse Hirsh engages in a thought-provoking dialogue with Tamika Abaka-Wood. The conversation begins with a whimsical touch, as Jesse humorously sets the scene at the Academy of the Impossible, where goats are supposedly vying for seats, hinting at the spontaneity that characterizes their discussion. From there, the conversation transitions into the intricate realms of anthropology, America, and ancestors. Jesse employs a clever alliteration to frame their chat, aiming to explore the often complex relationships between cultural identity and historical lineage. In a podcast episode that blends humor with serious inquiry, the duo navigates the nuances of how ancestral connections shape individual identities in contemporary society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamika shares her unique project, Dial-an-Ancestor, a hotline that allows individuals to engage with their cultural heritage in a participatory manner. This initiative invites users to either listen to the voices of their ancestors or share their own stories, fostering a dialogue that transcends time and space. The beauty of this project lies in its ability to provoke introspection about one&#39;s identity and the familial threads that weave through personal history. As the conversation unfolds, Tamika reflects on the philosophical implications of ancestry, urging listeners to reconsider their assumptions about the past and recognize the ongoing relevance of their ancestral connections in shaping their present and future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dialogue also touches upon the broader socio-political landscape in America, highlighting how cultural anthropology can provide insights into the current climate. Jesse and Tamika discuss the dissonance between established narratives and individual experiences, particularly in light of recent societal upheavals. They address the complexities of identity politics, acknowledging the importance of intergenerational dialogue as a tool for building resilience against rising authoritarianism. As the episode draws to a close, listeners are left with a sense of empowerment, encouraged to engage with their ancestry and consider how these connections can inform their roles in a rapidly changing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jesse and Tamika explore the concept of &#39;dial-an-ancestor&#39;, emphasizing a present-focused view of ancestry that challenges traditional notions of time. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The discussion highlights the importance of spontaneity in conversations, as both speakers navigate various topics with ease and wit. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Tamika shares her insights on the cultural dynamics of work, advocating for a radical rethinking of corporate culture to prioritize well-being and human connection. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The episode touches on the need for intergenerational dialogue, suggesting that engaging with diverse perspectives enriches our understanding of identity and community. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Tamika articulates her evolving relationship with anthropology, viewing it as a source of power and a tool for social change in contemporary America. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation underscores the significance of humor and empathy in navigating complex social and political landscapes, fostering deeper connections among individuals. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links referenced in this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cornerbooth.work&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cornerbooth.work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dial-an-ancestor.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dial-an-ancest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dialinancestor&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;or&lt;/a&gt;.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;The conversation between Jesse Hirsh and Ted Whetstone delves into the concept of adaptive leadership, a term that Hirsh humorously claims to have coined himself. Whetstone, a leadership coach, articulates the pressing need for adaptive leadership in a world rife with uncertainty, complexity, and the constant demand for reinvention. Throughout their discussion, they explore how traditional models of leadership are becoming obsolete in the face of complex societal and organizational challenges. Whetstone emphasizes that leadership is no longer about exerting authority but about fostering agency among individuals within a system. This shift towards recognizing the interconnectedness of people within organizations reflects a broader societal evolution towards inclusivity and shared decision-making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whetstone further discusses how the current era is characterized by rapid change, necessitating a departure from conventional, hierarchical leadership models towards a more collaborative approach. The dialogue invites listeners to reflect on the emotional responses triggered by uncertainty and complexity, advocating for a mindset that embraces learning and adaptability rather than fear and rigidity. Through anecdotes and insights, Whetstone illustrates the importance of creating environments where individuals feel empowered to contribute their ideas and perspectives, thus cultivating a culture of emergent leadership. In a light-hearted yet profound manner, they discuss the potential for organizations to thrive by nurturing collective intelligence and resilience, underscoring the vital role of adaptive leadership in navigating the complexities of the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Ted Whetstone emphasizes that adaptive leadership is essential in navigating today&#39;s complexities and uncertainties. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; He suggests that true leadership should inspire others to lead, creating a ripple effect of empowerment within organizations. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation highlights the need for organizations to embrace learning as a continuous process rather than a one-time event. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Whetstone argues that emotional responses to uncertainty can either hinder or enhance leadership effectiveness, depending on how they are managed. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The podcast underscores the importance of creating a common conceptual language to improve communication and collaboration in diverse teams. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Whetstone asserts that organizations must shift their focus from short-term profits to long-term sustainability and stakeholder value. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links referenced in this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tedwhetstone.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tedwhetstone.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://despair.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;despair.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thetirednurse.etsy.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thetirednurse.etsy.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;A lively and provocative exchange unfolds as Jesse Hirsh welcomes back Mike Oppenheim, the radical American wackadoo, for an insightful discussion about the myriad crises facing North America today. With a playful opening that features a backdrop of goats and other farm animals, Hirsh sets the stage for a conversation that melds humor with serious societal critique. The pair tackles the overwhelming sense of shared insanity that has gripped the continent, illustrating how personal experiences of madness have evolved into a collective hallucination, shaped by the pervasive influence of media and social interactions. Hirsh proposes that understanding this phenomenon is crucial, coining the episode&#39;s focus around the intertwined themes of money, generational dynamics, and the notion of union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the conversation progresses, Oppenheim shares his disillusionment with contemporary culture, particularly within the film industry, expressing a sense of helplessness that resonates with many listeners. They explore the implications of wealth distribution and the generational divide, particularly how baby boomers have shaped the current political and economic landscape. Both Hirsh and Oppenheim employ clever remarks and light-hearted banter throughout the dialogue, ensuring that the discussion remains engaging while addressing the weighty issues at hand. The exploration of how the ruling class might allow the economy to falter without consequence for themselves raises critical questions about societal inequality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the episode, Hirsh introduces the radical notion of a union for podcasters, a concept designed to empower creators in a landscape increasingly marred by misinformation and political divisiveness. Oppenheim’s skepticism regarding unions adds depth to the discussion, as they navigate the complexities of inclusivity and the potential for ideological clashes within such a collective. This thought-provoking episode not only highlights the urgent need for unity in times of crisis but also leaves listeners reflecting on their roles in shaping the future of media and society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; In this episode, Jesse Hirsh and Mike Oppenheim delve into the shared insanity of North America, highlighting how the crisis has evolved into a collective experience of mania rather than isolated incidents. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; They discuss the implications of generational wealth and the responsibility of boomers in shaping current political landscapes, acknowledging the complex relationship generations have with power and change. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation touches upon the role of media in shaping perceptions, with both speakers expressing skepticism about the influence of media narratives on public opinion and political action. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Oppenheim expresses concern about the rise of a new class of politicians who may exploit societal divisions, pointing to historical parallels that reflect the current political climate in America. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; They explore the idea of a podcasters&#39; union, emphasizing the need for solidarity among creators while questioning the challenges of inclusivity in a polarized media environment. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The discussion wraps up with a humorous nod to the absurdities of contemporary political discourse, reminding listeners of the importance of critical thinking and the necessity of questioning mainstream narratives. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh and Mike Oppenheim dive into the profound and provocative topic of the death of the future, exploring the current state of America and the rise of anti-establishment politics. The conversation unfolds with Hirsh&#39;s signature icebreaker segments, where he prompts Oppenheim to discuss the news and future trends that are capturing his attention. Oppenheim candidly reflects on his thoughts about democracy in America, the stark inequality in wealth distribution, and even a light-hearted jab about the Kansas City Chiefs&#39; performance in the Super Bowl. As they transition into deeper themes, Hirsh and Oppenheim grapple with the complexities of societal communication, the challenges of political discourse, and the importance of humor in navigating these turbulent times. They emphasize the need for understanding and connection amidst a backdrop of division, highlighting that the potential for laughter and shared experiences can be a powerful antidote to the overwhelming negativity that often pervades political discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their dialogue takes an intriguing turn as they address the concept of a &#39;great reset,&#39; with Oppenheim suggesting that change is on the horizon, albeit not in the simplistic manner many might hope for. He notes that the idea of a reset is often misinterpreted, and Hirsh skillfully weaves in the notion that the future is not predetermined but rather a series of choices that can lead to different outcomes. The hosts reflect on the various cultural enclaves within America, questioning how understanding these differences can lead to more fruitful conversations. The episode culminates in a philosophical exploration of death—not just as a physical end, but as an existential theme that connects deeply with how society perceives its future. Ultimately, Hirsh and Oppenheim challenge listeners to reconsider their views on democracy, societal engagement, and the necessity of humor as a tool for connection in an increasingly fragmented world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world that feels ever more chaotic and disjointed, Jesse Hirsh and Mike Oppenheim&#39;s conversation about the death of the future offers a refreshing perspective on the current state of America. They tackle the rise of anti-establishment sentiments, urging listeners to refocus on the importance of communication and connection. Hirsh&#39;s icebreaker segments lead into deeper discussions about the nature of democracy, as Oppenheim reflects on his doubts regarding its existence in America. The duo artfully balances wit and seriousness as they explore heavy topics, including wealth inequality and the cultural divides that shape political discourse. Oppenheim’s humorous takes on sports and current events serve to lighten the mood while still addressing significant societal concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The episode further delves into the concept of a &#39;great reset&#39;, where Oppenheim expresses his belief in a necessary upheaval, while Hirsh navigates the complexities of such a reset within the context of a multi-generational society. The pair emphasizes the value of humor and empathy as essential tools for fostering understanding across political divides. Their engaging dialogue invites listeners to reflect on the broader implications of living in a world that often feels devoid of hope while also encouraging a shared sense of responsibility towards one another. They posit that recognizing our shared humanity—even in the face of profound differences—can lead to a more optimistic outlook on the future, ultimately challenging the notion that the future is indeed &#39;dead.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the episode wraps, Hirsh and Oppenheim reinforce the idea that the future is not merely a path to be followed but a canvas upon which individuals can paint their aspirations and fears. They explore how societal narratives shape our understanding of the future, suggesting that a collective sense of purpose can emerge from shared laughter and honest dialogue.

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh engages in a thought-provoking discussion with Jeremiah Patterson about the pressing future of journalism amidst rising authoritarianism. They delve into the critical need for historical awareness, emphasizing how the lessons of the past can illuminate the threats independent journalists face today, particularly from fascist movements. Patterson articulates that the survival of journalism hinges on mass resistance and the importance of grassroots movements to combat oppressive forces. As they explore the current chaotic political landscape, both Hirsh and Patterson highlight the necessity for journalists to embrace a more engaged and vulnerable approach in their reporting, fostering trust and connection with their audiences. This episode serves as a rallying cry for listeners to recognize the urgency of their role in preserving democratic values and the integrity of the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://linktr.ee/tjpsnews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The future of journalism faces significant challenges as authoritarianism rises, impacting independent journalists and their ability to report freely. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Understanding history is paramount; it provides context to current events and helps recognize the warning signs of authoritarianism. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Mass resistance is essential to counteract the threats posed by fascism and uphold democratic values in society. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Independent journalism serves a crucial role in exposing corruption and underreported local stories, fostering community engagement and awareness. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The decline of local journalism is alarming, as it diminishes public awareness of critical issues affecting communities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Objectivity in journalism is evolving; reporters must balance truth-telling with the urgency of raising alarms about authoritarian threats. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Host Jesse Hirsh engages in a thought-provoking conversation with guest Cesar Cardona, exploring the intricate themes of interdependence, mindfulness, and the role of the trickster in society. The crux of their dialogue revolves around the notion that while individualism is prevalent in today&#39;s culture, a collective approach is necessary for societal advancement and environmental stewardship. Cardona emphasizes that the current political climate, exemplified by figures like Trump, serves as a reminder of the lessons we must learn about community and care for one another, especially in times of crisis. As they navigate through various societal challenges, both Hirsh and Cardona advocate for a shift from a profit-centric mindset to one that prioritizes the well-being of individuals and the planet. The episode ultimately highlights the importance of fostering dialogue, understanding, and collaboration as essential steps toward a harmonious future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Cesar highlighted the importance of interdependence over individualism, emphasizing that true progress comes from collaboration and unity. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation explored how societal changes, including economic disparities, can be addressed through mindful engagement and community support. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jesse and Cesar discussed the role of the trickster archetype in society, particularly in relation to political figures and their impact on public perception. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Cesar pointed out that while poverty rates have decreased globally, the narrative often focuses on fear and negativity, overshadowing positive developments. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; They agreed that mindfulness is key to navigating the complexities of modern life, especially in a fast-paced, convenience-driven society. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The episode concluded with a call for action, urging listeners to engage with businesses that prioritize social responsibility and community well-being. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://cesarcardona.com/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#podmatch&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh engages in a thought-provoking dialogue with Phyllis Leavitt, focusing on the critical theme of interdependency in today&#39;s society. Leavitt emphasizes that embracing interdependency is essential for healing both individual and collective wounds, suggesting that a lack of listening and vulnerability has led to societal dysfunction. As they explore the implications of mental health on politics, the conversation underscores the need for compassion and empathy in addressing the pervasive issues of violence and societal division. Leavitt also advocates for a transformative approach to American culture, proposing that the nation collectively undergo &quot;therapy&quot; to confront its challenges and foster a more inclusive community. This enlightening episode encourages listeners to reflect on their own roles in shaping a resilient and compassionate society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phyllis Leavitt&#39;s interview with Jesse Hirsh unfolds as a compelling exploration of interdependency, vulnerability, and the healing potential within both individuals and society. Their conversation begins with a discussion of a powerful sermon delivered by a bishop, which serves as a catalyst for examining how compassion and courage can inspire positive change. Leavitt, a psychotherapist with over three decades of experience, shares her views on the importance of standing up for one&#39;s values without resorting to blame or aggression. This sets the stage for a broader discourse on the urgent need for collective healing in a world increasingly marked by division and conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to their dialogue is the concept of &#39;America in Therapy,&#39; which Leavitt presents as a metaphor for addressing the psychological and emotional wounds that plague the nation. She argues that vulnerability, often mistaken for weakness, is in fact a source of strength that can lead to deeper connections and understanding. As Hirsh and Leavitt discuss the implications of individual actions on the collective future, the conversation emphasizes the interconnectedness of all people, urging listeners to recognize that their well-being is inextricably linked to the well-being of others and the health of the planet. This theme resonates throughout the episode, encouraging a shift away from individualistic paradigms towards a more community-oriented mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the conversation progresses, Leavitt addresses the need for a cultural transformation that values empathy and listening over competition and defensiveness. She underlines the importance of educating individuals about the psychological impacts of societal dynamics, advocating for a grassroots approach to healing that can manifest in everyday interactions. The episode concludes with a call to action for listeners to embrace their roles in fostering kindness, understanding, and interdependence, ultimately painting a hopeful picture of what a more compassionate society could look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Phyllis emphasizes the importance of embracing interdependency as a crucial aspect of healing both individuals and communities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The discussion highlights the necessity of vulnerability in leadership, arguing that true strength comes from openness and accountability. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Phyllis articulates that the collective mental health of society significantly influences political dynamics and the treatment of marginalized groups. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation underscores that empathy in discourse can bridge divides, allowing for more constructive engagement among differing perspectives. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; A key takeaway is the assertion that healing societal wounds requires acknowledging the intertwined fates of individuals and communities, especially in moments of crisis. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Phyllis advocates for a shift from punitive measures to restorative justice, emphasizing that understanding the trauma behind actions leads to true healing. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;The future of health policy is at the forefront of this engaging conversation between Jesse Hirsh and Greg Vigdor, as they explore the pressing issues surrounding access to healthcare and the implications of emerging medical technologies. Vigdor emphasizes the stark reality of healthcare inequality, especially in the context of high-cost treatments like cancer therapies and the potential societal fallout from unequal access. They delve into the complexities of healthcare systems, discussing how the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing fractures and mistrust within these systems. The episode also touches on the pivotal role of storytelling and fiction in making health policy more accessible to the public, fostering engagement and understanding. As they navigate the challenges and opportunities within healthcare, they highlight the need for a shift towards patient-centered care and the importance of community in rebuilding trust in health systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation between Jesse Hirsh and Greg Vigdor is a deep exploration of the challenges and opportunities within health policy, particularly as it relates to new medical technologies and their accessibility. Vigdor highlights a critical tension in the healthcare system: while advancements such as Ozempic and WeGovy hold the potential to revolutionize treatment for chronic conditions, they also raise significant questions about who gets access to these life-altering therapies. The discussion emphasizes the urgent need for a more equitable healthcare system, one where the benefits of scientific progress are available to all, not just the privileged few. Vigdor calls for public engagement and advocacy to ensure that health policy reflects the needs and rights of patients, thus fostering a more inclusive dialogue around healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dialogue also delves into the implications of recent political developments in health policy, particularly the nomination of figures like RFK Jr. Vigdor expresses his concerns regarding the contradictions presented by such political figures, who may advocate for important health issues while simultaneously rejecting established medical science. This tension speaks to a broader crisis of trust in health authorities and the need for a societal shift towards evidence-based discussions about health policy. The conversation serves as a crucial reminder of the importance of informed public discourse, urging listeners to become advocates for change in the healthcare landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the episode, Vigdor introduces a provocative idea: a national healthcare lottery to address the disparities in access to high-cost medical treatments. This radical suggestion serves to challenge listeners&#39; perceptions of healthcare access and equity, highlighting the often arbitrary nature of how medical resources are allocated. Through their engaging dialogue, Hirsh and Vigdor illuminate the critical issues facing health policy today and inspire listeners to rethink the structures that govern healthcare access and equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Healthcare policy needs more public engagement as it&#39;s essential to everyone involved. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The challenges of access to expensive medications highlight the inequalities within the health system. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Patient-centered care models could shift the focus from profit-driven healthcare to actual patient needs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility and distrust in public health systems globally. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; We must address the social dynamics of healthcare to foster equity and trust among communities. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Storytelling and fiction can be powerful tools to engage the public in health policy discussions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://gregvigdor.com/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Brands are navigating a rapidly evolving landscape in the age of AI, and this episode dives deep into the intersection of technology, storytelling, and consumer experience. Host Jesse Hirsh is joined by Gabriel Kaam, who shares insights on how AI is reshaping brand strategies and customer interactions. They discuss the importance of striking the right balance between technology and human touch in creating genuine connections with consumers. Gabriel emphasizes that while AI can enhance creativity and efficiency, the emotional resonance of storytelling remains essential for effective marketing. The conversation also touches on the challenges brands face with SEO in a world where AI is transforming how people search for information, leading to new opportunities and potential pitfalls for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigating the future of branding amidst rapid technological advancements takes center stage as Jesse Hirsh interviews Gabriel Kaam.

The discussion shifts to the French AI landscape, where companies like Mistral represent a burgeoning innovation sector that could rival established players. Hirsh and Kaam reflect on how storytelling remains a vital component of branding, even in an AI-driven world. Kaam posits that effective storytelling, enhanced by AI tools, can bridge the gap between consumers and brands, fostering deeper connections. The episode concludes with a critical look at how brands must strategically navigate the complexities of AI, ensuring that technological integration enhances rather than detracts from the authenticity and emotional resonance of their messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; In the age of AI, brands must adapt quickly to meet shifting consumer expectations and experiences. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The French AI industry, exemplified by companies like Mistral, is emerging as a competitive force. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Storytelling remains crucial for brands; AI can enhance creativity but human touch is irreplaceable. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; As search engines evolve, brands need to rethink their SEO strategies in the AI landscape. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Fashion and technology must harmonize; aesthetics play a critical role in user adoption of new devices. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; AI tools for creative processes are rapidly evolving; staying updated is essential for agencies. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;The dialogue between Jesse Hirsh and Jason Willis-Lee offers a profound exploration of the future of work, particularly through the lens of language services in the age of AI. Jason, a medical translator with a background in broadcasting, emphasizes the importance of human-in-the-loop systems, arguing that AI should enhance, not replace, the human element in translation. He shares his recent experiences at PodFest 2025, where he engaged with fellow broadcasters and delved into the transformative role of podcasting as a modern communication medium. Jason&#39;s insights illuminate how podcasting, much like radio before it, can shape public discourse, but he also cautions against its potential for polarization, mirroring the current political climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation naturally transitions to the challenges posed by misinformation, particularly in the medical field. Jason asserts that there is a pressing need for professionals to translate complex medical jargon into accessible language for the general public. This necessity is underscored by the concerning trend of public distrust in established scientific authorities, amplified by political decisions and the rise of conspiracy theories. The episode highlights the vital role that communication specialists play in bridging these gaps, ensuring that crucial information reaches those who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the episode wraps up, Jason shares his philosophy on continuous learning and networking, stressing the importance of building relationships within the industry. He describes how attending events like PodFest not only fosters personal growth but also facilitates connections that can lead to collaborative opportunities. The insights shared in this episode serve as a roadmap for professionals navigating the evolving landscape of work, emphasizing a proactive approach to embracing technology while prioritizing human connections and effective communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The future of work involves human-supervised AI, enhancing productivity without replacing human roles. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Language is evolving rapidly; colloquial language changes faster than technical language, impacting communication. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Networking at events is crucial for personal and professional growth; face-to-face connections matter. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; AI should be seen as a tool to improve efficiency, not as a job threat. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Translators must adapt to using AI tools to increase their productivity and output. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Emotional health and time management are key to preventing burnout in solopreneurs. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh engages in a captivating dialogue with Susan Macaulay, exploring the complex relationship between social media and local community engagement. The conversation kicks off with a discussion on the role of social media in modern politics, particularly in light of recent political shifts and the influence of figures like Mark Carney. Susan shares her personal experiences with platforms like Facebook, reflecting on the evolution of these sites from tools for connection to sources of frustration, particularly as algorithms increasingly dictate what content is visible. The duo delves deep into the implications of this shift, arguing that while social media can foster community ties, it can also breed division and misinformation, particularly during tumultuous political periods. They highlight how local groups on Facebook have become new arenas for political discourse, albeit often marked by incivility and misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the conversation unfolds, Susan presents her poetic reflections on the nature of online interactions, emphasizing the need for civility and constructive discourse. The discussion shifts towards the future of social media and its potential to either enhance or hinder community connections. Jesse and Susan ponder the paradox of social media as both a facilitator of community engagement and a source of cognitive overload, questioning what it means to be a part of a digital community in an era marked by information saturation.

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh engages Chris Hood in a thought-provoking discussion about the ideologies surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) and the inherent gap between its promises and reality. The conversation opens with a critical examination of recent announcements from the Trump administration regarding AI investments and the illusion of progress that often accompanies such news. Chris Hood shares insights from his upcoming book, revealing a significant seven-year gap between public perception of AI capabilities and their actual technological advancements. The dialogue emphasizes that while AI holds potential, many of its touted achievements remain speculative, and the reality often lags behind the hype. As the discussion progresses, both Jesse and Chris explore the potential consequences of this disconnect, including a possible “AI bubble” that may burst as consumers and investors realize the limitations of current AI technologies. This notion is further compounded by the increasing awareness among consumers about the difference between marketing hype and actual product capability, leading to skepticism about the future of AI investments and innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discussion takes a turn towards the philosophical, as Chris Hood proposes that the current discourse around AI reflects a broader ideological belief system—equating AI with infallibility. This belief is scrutinized through various examples, from the simplistic use of AI in everyday applications to the more complex implications of relying on technology to address non-existent problems. Hood argues that the marketing strategies employed by tech companies promote a narrative that positions AI as a panacea for all issues, neglecting the reality that many solutions do not require AI. Through anecdotes and critical analysis, the conversation reveals how this ideology can lead to misguided expectations, potentially undermining genuine advancements in technology and critical thinking skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the episode draws to a close, Jesse and Chris pivot to the role of gaming in fostering critical thinking and emotional intelligence. Chris discusses how video games can serve as a medium for developing collaboration and compassion, while also recognizing the challenges posed by the increasing use of AI in creative industries. The conversation underscores the importance of maintaining a customer-first approach in technological development, advocating for a model where technology serves real consumer needs rather than the whims of corporate hype. Ultimately, this episode serves as a clarion call for a more nuanced understanding of AI, urging listeners to engage with technology critically and thoughtfully, lest they fall victim to the illusions perpetuated by the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The narrative surrounding AI often exceeds its actual capabilities, creating unmet expectations. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; AI ideologies can distort the public&#39;s understanding of technology and its practical applications. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Customer-first approaches should guide technology adoption rather than succumbing to industry hype. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Generative AI&#39;s potential impact on critical thinking skills is a growing concern among educators. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The gaming industry illustrates the tension between technology and creativity in modern development. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Understanding the difference between marketing-driven belief and actual AI functionality is crucial. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;This episode dives into the complexities of contemporary politics and media, focusing on the roles of the fourth and fifth estates in shaping narratives around fascism and far-right movements. Host Jesse Hirsh engages with guest Rick Salutin to explore the shifting landscape of Canadian politics, particularly in the wake of Justin Trudeau&#39;s leadership and the rise of Pierre Polievre. The conversation also touches on the challenges of engaging with mainstream media narratives, the importance of grassroots movements, and the potential for new coalitions to emerge.

With humor and depth, the duo examines the implications of these narratives for the future of democracy and social movements in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The podcast delves into the chaos of contemporary media, politics, and society&#39;s response to fascism. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Rick Salutin expresses optimism about the current state of Canadian politics and media narratives. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The role of social media in shaping political discourse and public perception is critiqued. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Both hosts discuss the impact of the AI bubble and its marketing illusion in society. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Trudeau&#39;s leadership is analyzed in comparison to Poliev&#39;s approach and their respective political personas. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Salutin highlights the importance of grassroots movements in shifting political narratives and power dynamics. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh engages in a thought-provoking dialogue with John Wolfstone, centered on the concept of community in today&#39;s increasingly fragmented world. As they explore the notion of intentional communities, John shares insights from his experiences at Tamera, a thriving polyamorous village in Portugal that emerged from the trauma of fascism in Europe. The conversation delves into how communities can serve as a counterbalance to rising authoritarianism and alienation in society, emphasizing the need for inclusivity and solidarity among diverse groups. John articulates that true community goes beyond mere friendship; it is about shared responsibility and mutual care, where individuals support one another irrespective of their differences. This exploration also touches on the importance of vulnerability as a strength, suggesting that acknowledging one’s loneliness can pave the way for deeper connections and healing in a society plagued by loneliness and division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dialogue navigates the complexities of modern identity politics and the dangers of othering, particularly in North America, where political affiliations often define community boundaries. Jesse and John discuss how the rise of fascism is linked to a culture of exclusion and fear, highlighting the urgent need to cultivate spaces that embrace diversity and foster understanding. Through their exchange, they articulate a vision of community that not only engages with the current socio-political landscape but actively seeks to transcend it. John posits that embracing our differences and entering conversations with an open heart can lead to transformative changes in how we relate to one another. The episode serves as a rallying cry for individuals to step into their power, recognizing that the act of building community is an essential response to the crises of our time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation culminates in John&#39;s upcoming summit, &#39;Fugitive Futures,&#39; which aims to gather thought leaders and community builders to explore regenerative culture and collective healing. This event is framed as an opportunity to engage with the uncertainties of the future, encouraging participants to share their grief, hopes, and visions for a better world. John emphasizes that the summit is not merely about answers but about creating a space for dialogue and experimentation in the face of societal challenges. As they reflect on the potential for communities to emerge from the shadows of despair, Jesse and John inspire listeners to envision a future where solidarity and empathy reign, and where the power of community becomes a transformative agent for change. The episode ultimately leaves audiences with a sense of hope and a call to action, inviting them to participate in the ongoing journey toward a more connected and just society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation emphasizes the urgency of community in an increasingly isolated and alienated society. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; John Wolfstone highlights the importance of vulnerability as a foundational element of true community. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The role of storytelling is crucial in shaping the future and building connections. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Tamara community serves as a model of resilience, focusing on healing and inclusion amidst conflict. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Recognizing the biological imperative for social connection can help address the loneliness epidemic. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Engaging in open-minded dialogue with differing viewpoints is essential for fostering understanding and growth. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;#podmatch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://thevillageoflovers.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://thevillageoflovers.com/summit&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh engages in a thought-provoking conversation with Michaell Magrutsche, delving into the pressing issues surrounding awareness, technology, and humanity. They explore the idea that while technology, particularly AI, continues to evolve rapidly, human consciousness seems to lag behind, leading to a disconnect between our technological advancements and personal growth. Michaell emphasizes the importance of reclaiming our humanity and awareness, suggesting that genuine creativity acts as a vital medium for expressing and understanding our interconnectedness with nature and each other. The discussion touches on the detrimental effects of distraction in a fast-paced, technology-driven world and the need to shift our focus from mere knowledge to deeper awareness. Ultimately, this episode serves as a call to reconnect with ourselves and the world around us, highlighting that true fulfillment lies in recognizing our place within the larger tapestry of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Michael emphasizes the importance of awareness over knowledge, stating that awareness is crucial in today&#39;s rapidly evolving technological landscape. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation highlights the need for humanity to reconnect with nature, as technology continues to segregate us from our natural roots. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jesse and Michael discuss the paradox of technological advancement, which often distracts humans from personal and collective evolution. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Michael argues that financial principles should be updated to reflect the interconnectedness of humanity and nature, moving away from the scarcity mindset. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The episode suggests that creativity is a powerful tool for self-discovery and awareness, allowing individuals to express their unique perspectives. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Both host and guest agree that while technology advances, human evolution seems stagnant, raising questions about our future path. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links referenced in this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://michaellm.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;michaellm.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Social media is at a pivotal moment, and this episode dives deep into the question of whether it can be saved or reimagined. Jesse Hirsh leads a dynamic discussion with guests David Mason, Jeanette Herrle, Sherida Ryan, and Greg Majster, exploring the polarizing nature of platforms like Twitter and TikTok, and the implications of their algorithms on public discourse. The conversation highlights the need for transparency, accountability, and the potential for social media to foster genuine connections rather than division. The panelists challenge the existing structures and propose innovative ideas like cooperative systems and educational frameworks to encourage more meaningful participation. As they navigate the complexities of social media&#39;s role in today&#39;s society, they collectively envision a future where the medium serves the many, not the few, fostering a healthier digital environment for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh invites a panel of thought leaders, including David Mason, Jeanette Herrle, Sherida Ryan, and Greg Majster (Stro1), to engage in a dynamic conversation about the future of social media in an era marked by political upheaval and societal changes. The discussion kicks off with an evaluation of the current state of social media platforms, particularly in light of recent events such as the inauguration of a controversial president and the implications of unchecked online discourse. The panelists express concerns over the role of social media in facilitating polarization and the spread of misinformation, questioning whether these platforms can be reformed or if they are fundamentally flawed. David Mason prompts a reflection on the original intentions of social media as spaces for connection and community, contrasting that with the present reality where algorithms prioritize sensationalism over meaningful engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst these reflections, the conversation also touches on themes of anonymity, safety, and the potential for social media to empower users rather than undermine individual agency. Jeanette highlights the historical parallels between the rise of print media and the current digital landscape, suggesting that just as the printing press democratized information, social media has the potential to do the same—if appropriately harnessed. The panelists explore the idea of creating a more equitable social media framework that encourages diverse voices and fosters constructive dialogue, rather than amplifying extremist views. They consider how user participation could be incentivized through innovative structural changes, such as promoting transparency and accountability among platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the dialogue leads to a consensus that social media must evolve into a space that prioritizes community over chaos, empowering users while also establishing necessary guidelines for responsible interaction. The discussion concludes with a call to action for listeners to rethink their relationship with social media, advocating for a collective effort to reclaim these platforms as tools for good, promoting solidarity and understanding in a fragmented digital world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The future of social media needs to prioritize transparency and equitable participation for all users. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Social media platforms must evolve to foster open dialogue rather than amplifying extreme voices. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; A reimagined social media should encourage users to share diverse perspectives without fear of backlash. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Community-driven content creation can help mitigate the negative effects of algorithm-driven polarization. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Education and media literacy are vital for empowering users to navigate social media responsibly. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The current model of social media often benefits the few at the expense of the many. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh engages in a profound dialogue with Cory Doctorow, exploring the current socio-political landscape shaped by technology and governance. As they navigate the implications of AI nationalism and authoritarianism, Doctorow offers insights into how these trends echo historical patterns of control and resistance. The conversation delves into the mechanics of social media and the importance of interoperability among platforms like Blue Sky and Mastodon, emphasizing that the future of online communication hinges on user agency and freedom from corporate entrapment. Doctorow articulates a vision for a more decentralized digital ecosystem, where users can migrate seamlessly between platforms without losing their social connections. This dialogue is underscored by the urgency of responding to growing authoritarianism, and Doctorow’s reflections on the necessity of community and solidarity in the face of systemic oppression resonate deeply throughout the episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Cory Doctorow emphasizes the importance of understanding that capitalism has various forms, each with different implications for society. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The conversation explores the growing divide between for-profit and non-profit social media platforms and their impact on users. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Doctorow argues that personal relationships, rather than data, are the main reason people stay on social media platforms. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The discussion highlights the need for better interoperability in social media to empower users to leave if they choose. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Jesse Hirsh and Cory Doctorow discuss the implications of authoritarian nationalism in the context of the current political climate. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Doctorow shares insights on how the Digital Millennium Copyright Act restricts creative freedom and hampers innovation in the digital age. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links referenced in this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pluralistic.net&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pluralistic.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://libro.fm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;libro.fm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://downpour.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;downpour.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://craphound.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;craphound.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Exploring the intricacies of outrage culture and its impact on public discourse, Jesse Hirsh and David Beckemeyer engage in a thought-provoking conversation that sheds light on the current state of information consumption and political engagement. The discussion opens with the implications of the Supreme Court&#39;s TikTok ban, which Beckemeyer uses as a springboard to delve into the psychological factors driving political behavior, particularly the concept of humiliation in American politics. Through their analysis, they reveal how feelings of humiliation can lead to extreme political actions and responses, citing notable examples from contemporary figures. They emphasize that these emotional drivers create a fertile ground for misinformation and polarization, creating a cycle that is difficult to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the podcast progresses, Hirsh and Beckemeyer tackle the pressing issue of media literacy, stating that while it is vital for individuals to understand the information landscape, this knowledge must be complemented by an awareness of the social dynamics at play. They argue that fostering empathy and dignity in conversations—especially with ideological opponents—is crucial for bridging divides in an increasingly fragmented society. Beckemeyer highlights that engaging with differing viewpoints does not equate to agreement; rather, it enriches one&#39;s understanding and strengthens advocacy for one&#39;s beliefs. The importance of personal responsibility in maintaining mental health amid the chaos of outrage culture is also underscored, suggesting that a bottom-up approach can help cultivate a more resilient public discourse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation culminates in a call to action, urging listeners to foster community, practice empathy, and engage constructively with those who hold differing views. By sharing personal anecdotes about interactions in various social contexts, Hirsh and Beckemeyer illustrate how meaningful connections can transcend political differences. The episode serves as a reminder that despite the challenges posed by outrage culture and misinformation, there is potential for dialogue and understanding, emphasizing that humanity should prevail in our interactions, regardless of ideological divides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The culture of outrage is overwhelming our ability to have constructive discourse and dialogue. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Empathy is essential for understanding opposing views and fostering better communication. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Media literacy is evolving but often weaponized, complicating our understanding of information. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Civic engagement requires not just knowledge but a willingness to connect with others. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Building community and solidarity can counteract the negativity of online interactions. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Incentives must be realigned to promote dignity and respect in public discourse. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links referenced in this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://outrageoverload.net&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;outrageoverload.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

They discuss the implications of AI on storytelling, emphasizing how these tools can empower aspiring creators to express their visions more freely than ever before. As they navigate the complexities of AI, copyright issues, and the evolving media landscape, Archer provides insights into the collaborative spirit within community media that fosters creativity and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation between Jesse Hirsh and Erich Archer dives deep into the intersection of storytelling, technology, and community engagement, particularly through the lens of generative AI and its implications for public broadcasting. Archer, an executive director at a community media station, provides valuable insights into how AI tools are revolutionizing the creative landscape, making it possible for anyone to tell their story with minimal resources. This democratization of creativity is a central theme, as they explore how technology can empower individuals to become filmmakers and storytellers, regardless of their background or access to traditional media avenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the episode, they discuss the challenges facing public broadcasting in a rapidly evolving media landscape, particularly the funding issues exacerbated by the shift from cable to streaming.

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh engages in an enlightening conversation with Leighton Campbell about the importance of happiness and the concept of a &quot;happiness equation.&quot; Leighton emphasizes that happiness is not just a fleeting emotion but a dynamic state that individuals can actively influence. He argues that we have a moral obligation to maintain our happiness not only for ourselves but also for those around us, as our moods can significantly impact others. The discussion explores how community and belonging play crucial roles in our happiness, and Leighton provides insights on how to evaluate and improve one’s happiness through simple, actionable questions. This episode serves as a call to action for listeners to take charge of their emotional well-being and to contribute positively to their communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Hirsh hosts Leighton Campbell on Metaviews for a deep dive into the intricacies of happiness, exploring not only its definition but also its broader implications on personal and societal levels. Leighton challenges the conventional understanding of happiness as a passive experience, arguing that it is a proactive endeavor requiring conscious effort and moral accountability. He draws on his personal journey and insights from Dennis Prager, emphasizing that maintaining a positive outlook is not just beneficial for oneself, but a moral obligation to enhance the collective happiness of the community. This assertion sets the stage for a rich dialogue about how our moods and attitudes can influence others, creating a ripple effect that either uplifts or diminishes the emotional climate around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation then transitions into Leighton&#39;s innovative happiness equation, which serves as a practical tool for self-assessment. This equation, comprised of several targeted questions, allows individuals to gauge their happiness levels and pinpoint specific areas for growth. By engaging with this framework, listeners are encouraged to take actionable steps towards improving their emotional well-being, thereby making happiness a more attainable goal. Leighton&#39;s insights here are particularly valuable, as he provides a roadmap for navigating the often overwhelming landscape of personal fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the episode addresses the critical theme of community and belonging in the pursuit of happiness. Leighton offers sage advice on how to identify and engage with groups that foster supportive environments. He underscores the significance of seeking out connections that resonate and encourage personal growth, while also acknowledging the challenges of finding the right fit in social spheres. By fostering an understanding of the dynamic interplay between individual happiness and communal support, this episode serves as a compelling reminder of the collective responsibility we share in nurturing joy within our communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Leighton emphasizes that happiness is not just a result of circumstances, but something we have control over. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The happiness equation serves as a tool to encourage self-reflection and personal growth. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Creating a culture of happiness within organizations can enhance collective morale and productivity. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Building connections with communities is essential for individual happiness and social fulfillment. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Leighton argues that everyone has a moral obligation to maintain a positive demeanor in public. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Recognizing the need for belonging can help individuals navigate feelings of alienation and isolation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links referenced in this episode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://happinessseq.com&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;happinessseq.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/yourhappinesseq&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;instagram.com/yourhappinesseq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;#podmatch&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Join Jesse Hirsh as he engages in a fascinating conversation with David Fingrut, delving into the vibrant history of the media collective and its impact on Toronto&#39;s cultural landscape in the 1990s. They explore how this unique social network fostered collaboration among diverse individuals, bridging various political ideologies while promoting creative projects that challenged mainstream narratives. Fingrut shares insights on the collective&#39;s ethos, encapsulated in the slogan &quot;don&#39;t get caught,&quot; highlighting the interplay between activism, media, and public space. The discussion also touches on the evolution of grassroots movements, drawing parallels to contemporary events like Reclaim the Streets, which sought to reclaim urban spaces through creative protest. As they navigate these themes, Hirsh and Fingrut reflect on the ongoing relevance of these movements in today&#39;s socio-political climate, emphasizing the importance of community organizing and the fight for justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging in a rich conversation about the evolution of media and community activism, Jesse Hirsh and David Fingrut reflect on the legacy of the Media Collective, a group that flourished in Toronto during the late 1990s. Fingrut describes the Media Collective as a vibrant social network that convened in person to collaborate on creative projects, often infused with political undertones. The conversation reveals how the collective fostered a sense of community among diverse individuals who were passionate about media-making and social change, utilizing discussions and monthly meetings to share ideas and launch various initiatives. Hirsh emphasizes the cultural significance of the collective during a period marked by the rise of the internet and alternative media, suggesting that it represented a crucial turning point in how communities engaged with media production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delving deeper into the socio-political context of their experiences, the hosts discuss how the Media Collective intersected with movements like Reclaim the Streets, which sought to reclaim public space through creative protests. Fingrut recalls the playful yet poignant tactics employed, such as street theater and spontaneous gatherings, which contrasted sharply with conventional forms of activism. The dialogue highlights the necessity of physical presence and community organizing, especially when juxtaposed against the backdrop of today&#39;s digital landscape, where online activism often overshadows physical mobilization. As they navigate through the significance of these grassroots movements, both Hirsh and Fingrut underscore a collective yearning for a return to tangible, community-driven activism in the face of modern challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The episode culminates with a discussion on the future of activism and the role of media in shaping public discourse. The two ponder the implications of the current political climate, particularly as it relates to the rise of authoritarianism and the erosion of public spaces. They reflect on the lessons learned from the Media Collective and how those principles can inform contemporary movements seeking to reclaim agency in a world increasingly dominated by corporate interests. Hirsh and Fingrut&#39;s dialogue serves as a poignant reminder of the power of collective action, the importance of community, and the ongoing struggle for a more just and equitable society, urging listeners to reconsider their roles within these narratives of resistance and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

The conversation highlights the potential for Septemics to address societal discordance, offering accessible tools for anyone seeking to improve their lives and understanding of the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest episode of Metaviews features an enlightening conversation between host Jesse Hirsh and guest Jim Marshall, a polymathic intellectual renowned for his development of Septemics, a groundbreaking framework for understanding human behavior. The episode opens with a timely discussion about the potential ramifications of the Supreme Court&#39;s rulings on social media platforms like TikTok, setting the stage for deeper insights into the nature of knowledge and its application in our lives. Hirsch and Marshall explore how the specialized nature of contemporary society often leads to echo chambers and a lack of holistic understanding, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches to learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marshall shares his personal journey of over 50,000 hours dedicated to studying various aspects of human potential, underscoring the importance of lifelong learning and the cultivation of curiosity. His experiences reveal a profound understanding of how language and literacy impact our ability to connect, comprehend, and communicate effectively. He argues for a reevaluation of the educational system to prioritize vocabulary and language skills as fundamental tools for personal and societal development, which aligns with the core tenets of Septemics. By articulating human experiences through a seven-level hierarchy, Septemics serves as a practical tool for individuals seeking clarity in their relationships and personal dilemmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the episode, Marshall provides relatable examples, illustrating how Septemics can facilitate deeper self-awareness and problem-solving. The discussion culminates in an exploration of how this framework can address the discordance experienced in modern society, offering a pathway towards unity and understanding.

What does it take to build systems of power rooted in wisdom, nature, and participation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us as we examine the past, embrace the present, and chart a course for a more just and funky future.

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has transformed work and learning, and this will be &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;particularly evident as we emerge into a post-pandemic world. One &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;person’s disruption is another person’s opportunity. Similarly some &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;organizations have responded with incredible resilience, and are &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;experiencing unprecedented growth and success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically great crises and catastrophes are followed by renaissances &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and periods of incredible innovation. What’s the difference between &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;success and failure, between depression and excitement? Talent. This is &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;true for both individuals and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you foster and harness your talent? How do organizations attract,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; develop, and retain talent? These are crucial questions during this &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;transitional period as we remain in a pandemic but seek our path out of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;it!&lt;/p&gt;</p>

This is what happens when policy makers copy other jurisdictions blindly, rather than engage in a policy process that adapts to the needs of jurisdiction. Obviously policy makers can and should learn from each other and best practices, yet often the process is the purpose, and blindly copying others leads to problems down the road.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;Vasiliki Bednar leads us on a discussion on the potential of public platforrms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have come to rightfully resent the propaganda of the gig economy that assures us platform companies are equitable when they tend to be exploitative. But they don’t have to be predatory. Other jurisdictions are experimenting with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.coop/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;worker-owned platform co-operatives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not too hard to imagine public sector platforms. Indeed, we must first&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;re&lt;/strong&gt;-imagine them as we consider whether they are worth investing in and building in-house.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of places in the public sector that are characterized by matching problems that could be solved with an efficient platform designed with the public good in mind:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Substitute teachers and school boards;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teaching graduates and school boards;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical school graduates and residencies;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Personal support workers and home care;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Citizens and psychotherapists;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Postdoc positions at Canadian universities;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;*The province has&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theworkingcentre.org/regulated-professions/1151-ontarios-regulated-professions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a lot of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;regulated professions, but that doesn’t mean that all of them are characterized by matching inefficiencies. Bike share programs are also a neat case study re: public investment and/or partnership in bike sharing infrastructure.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have certain stereotypes that have come to be associated with platforms that we need to move past if we really want to reimagine them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is an ethical/responsible platform that benefits the very same labour that it showcases?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Can they exist and persist with a modest profit margin as a non-profit or thrive as a worker-owned co-operative? Can members embrace higher price points that support livable wages and benefits?&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;The pandemic has empowered professionals to pursue a balance between life and work, leading many to move out of major cities to find refuge in rural communities. What does this shift mean for the future of work and the role of super cities? How should government policies support rural economic development while also investing in cities as economic engines? Is the Internet transforming where we work? Fibre optic internet is one obvious essential requirement, but so are robust transportation networks, and self-driving vehicles. Can we work anywhere and everywhere?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘future of work’ is about more than work environments. The global challenge is to ensure that workers have the right resources to improve their lives, but to enable them to continue to work productively. For many this will mean the opportunity to live in a community that exists on a smaller, arguably human scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free fibre optic Internet to the home for everyone everywhere&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Active investment in transportation infrastructure and self driving vehicles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free online education for students of all ages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexible work policies that make it easier for people to choose where they work&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Affordable housing in rural environments as well as urban&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</p>

Although I’m not convinced that this is a technology story per se, but rather an investing, or scam story. In so far as the Art world is a combination of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example the figures cited in NFT stories. Those numbers are incorrect, as they are translations. In most cases these transactions are not in dollars, they are in tokens, or ether, as that’s the whole point. These are blockchain transactions, and the purchases are happening in crypto-currency, linking their value with the value of Bitcoin, or Ether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is relevant because of who would already have this currency, or who would be in a position to acquire it relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeal of such financing is understandable, if you’re willing to trust in this technology that seeks to automate trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately there are ample reasons for us to distrust it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, while the blockchain is designed to verify that items uploaded to the blockchain are indeed those items, that doesn’t prevent someone from uploading something they do not have the rights to upload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or what about the environmental impact? Or the cultural logic driving this entire process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discuss all of this and more.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">&lt;p&gt;This is the recording of a Metaviews salon we conducted in February 2021, with Vasiliki Bednar and Greg Majster. It was in response to a paper published that featured the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We are inspired by renewed calls to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/what-does-defund-police-mean.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Defund the Police&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the United States, which have reinvigorated vital debate regarding the funding of police departments, who is actually served by them, and what forms of historical injustice are perpetuated by current institutions of policing and incarceration. In the context of the abolitionist movement, to defund means to invite local and regional communities to decide how to redirect the disproportionate funds now invested in enforcement and imprisonment to support alternative, more holistic forms of well being and public safety infrastructure.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In the spirit of that movement, we adapt some of its key concepts to the domain of public/community information and communications (ICT) infrastructures, particularly those now dominated by Big Tech. Our proposal is grounded on a key premise: to redirect Big Tech ’s excessive revenue flow, we must transform the conditions and funding structures that enable it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The aim is to free up resources to support a wide range of socially beneficial ends, not least community-based and community-oriented initiatives to develop digital infrastructures that better serve the public interest. While we are not calling for the demise of Big Tech, we are calling for radical reform. This includes abolition of the conditions that create and normalize Big Tech’s disproportionate reach over key ICT infrastructure, and their wide ranging negative consequences for society and the environment. We aim to retain — and expand — the many benefits that people currently derive from digital technologies, while better addressing their individual and collective needs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read more here &lt;a href=&quot;https://techotherwise.pubpub.org/defund-big-tech&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://techotherwise.pubpub.org/defund-big-tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>

      <p class="episode-excerpt">This is a counter intuitive or contrarian position that starts to make sense the more you think of it.

Just as we would argue that individuals deserve privacy while corporations do not, perhaps there is a similar analogy here. That legislators deserver reasonable amounts of privacy, whereas the government as an organization does not.

James would argue that the construction of policies deserves secrecy, whereas the voting or passage of them does not. He also points out that before the secret ballot, people were often subject to political violence due to how they voted.

While James focuses on legislative transparency, I can’t help but see a similar lesson when it comes to the digital world and in particular algorithms.

Perhaps there is need for greater nuance there as well.</p>
