<p>Hi, I'm Jesse Hirsh and welcome to another episode of Metaview recorded live in front of an automated audience with some goats too, who are running to their seats as we speak. And today I'm going to speak with my good friend, new friend Rodolfo about the poultry industry amongst other topics.</p>
<p>I mean this is where you should know, Rodolfo, those titles I start with are usually aspirational. They're not necessarily what we will talk about, they're what we might talk about.</p>
<p>But I like to structure every meta views with kind of themes or pillars that we can wrap our conversation around.</p>
<p>In this case we've got poultry culture and Latin America and I'm not sure Rodolfo, I suspect you've watched Mediview's episode previously when you were.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:01:03</p>
<p>Yes I do.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:01:04</p>
<p>Researching me when I appeared before the Poultry School. But we start every Metaviews episode with the news, partly because we have our own newsletter.</p>
<p>And today we are actually talking about how Canada is kind of getting beat up lately by our old friend the United States, which is where you're currently joining us. I believe you're in El Paso if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p>So this is where we always throw to our guest Rodolfo and we say is there any news that you're paying attention to? Could be industry news, could be personal news, could be world news.</p>
<p>It's quite a range of really falling under the question of what should our audience be paying attention to? What are you paying attention to? So it gives us a kind of insight into your character.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:01:56</p>
<p>Well, first of all Jesse, thank you very much for the opportunity and I really like the way that you think and I really like the way that you drive these conversations.</p>
<p>And I'm laughing because when I start contact you and I ask you for an introduction meeting, I say hey, yes, maybe I will explain to you what is poetry school about that maybe about me. And then you answer me, Rodolfo, I have Google. I can Google so I can know about you more than you think.</p>
<p>I don't need like half hour you telling me because I have Google so that really opens my mind and that's really open a very nice connecting with you even before I met you when we did our podcast or our webinar two weeks ago with Poetry school. But going to your to your question, what news are in El Paso right now?</p>
<p>Obviously we have, we're a border city here and the migrant things, the migration with this new government, I don't want to say is good or bad, but it's capturing a Lot of attention. And then the news that also are related for the poultry industry are the tariffs that the USA is going to input. Well, is saying I'm going to do it.</p>
<p>I don't know if that's going to happen or not. Canada and Mexico, that I I think is going to be a big challenge in the production for a production of meats and eggs.</p>
<p>And another thing that is capturing my attention these days is that the eggs is a high commodity right now in the usa. They are very expensive. It's lack of of eggs. So it's different perspective and that just bring me that every day is bring different, let's say ideas.</p>
<p>So what happens yesterday can change really fast and we need to be prepared what is next and how to get this initiative going on and how to keep in the right direction. Jesse, so those are for migrants tariffs and now eating eggs is a luxury.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:04:11</p>
<p>In the U.S. that's scary. And we'll come back to that as well as your point about preparing for the future. But to ask you one quick follow up.</p>
<p>To what extent is the El Paso local dependent upon cross border traffic? And I mean both way.</p>
<p>I mean Americans going into Mexico and Mexicans coming into America and the politicization of the border or just the increased scrutiny on the border, can that have a negative effect on the local economy in terms of, you know, certainly here in Canada most of our economy is tied, you know, in Toronto it's Buffalo, you know where I live, it's Plattsburgh, New York. Like there's a lot of cross border traffic. So does this put the local economy in jeopardy?</p>
<p>Because it kind of depends upon people going back and forth.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:05:04</p>
<p>Yes, agree.</p>
<p>And the thing is that if you have been here in El Paso is a particular city, particular I'm going to say that because it's a USA city but it's a neighbor city with Juarez. And I need to point something. The culture of Juarez is not Mexico is Juarez culture.</p>
<p>The people that lives in Juarez, they live crossing the border very normal and doing some type of activities that doesn't happen in any other city in the U.S. another thing that is peculiar in El Paso is that we have a very one of the largest army bases for Blizz.</p>
<p>So it's a lot of military people here training. Okay.</p>
<p>So and how this, this is going to affect my son, my son lives in Guatemala and he works for a Guatemala company that they have a fried chicken chain in the USA and he says that since this government take place their sales has lowered down because their customers are the Migrants. Right. And then workers also they have lack of workers that maybe their status is not clear, maybe their status is in a gray area.</p>
<p>So they are afraid to go outside. So I think that manpower and some economy is going to be a hit.</p>
<p>But this new situation and we need to be open, Jesse, is that there are some jobs that migrants are willing to do that the local people are never going to do it. Going to the fields, spending so many hours outside like you are in winter or in hot summer.</p>
<p>There are activities that local people they're not going to do it. Even that there are over. So he's going to be invoice later about this.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:07:01</p>
<p>Yeah, 100% and in particular the agricultural industry really depends upon migrant labor all throughout North America. And it'll be interesting to see the consequences. To your point about paying the invoice later, it could be severe.</p>
<p>But that does bring us to our second segment of every Meta views, which is WTF or what's the Future? And this is where we are, a kind of future centric podcast. We like to anticipate what's coming next.</p>
<p>And just as we ask our guest what are you paying attention to right now in terms of the news, we also like to ask our guests, what do you see in the future? Granted, no one can really predict the future. We're not holding you to this.</p>
<p>It's more when you look at the event horizon, when you look as far ahead as you can, what do you see? What motivates you? What are you preparing for?</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:08:00</p>
<p>Well, I think that me, myself in my personal point of view and my history, I really, really believe and maybe I'm driving by this idea and my motivation is how to get into myself and tapping into my potential. Right.</p>
<p>So I was born in the 60s, the 80s was my teenager environment and later I think we're going to talk about that in Latin America where in those days the Latins at least in those days we were seeing USA like oh is like the big thing going to shopping and going to Disneyland. Right? But when you are here you say oh we were craving for this or.</p>
<p>Or then we were talking about another stories when I went to Europe or working in Asia that your perspective changed. But what is in the future?</p>
<p>I think that understanding how to handle and that is something that I love about you, how you handle technology, how you handle AI. That is a lot of confusion, the benefits or the threats or if it's good or bad or doesn't need any more human beings to do the job.</p>
<p>But I think that we need to Be focused. How to use the technology and how to get our potential and how to connect to our true unique selves.</p>
<p>The uniqueness, like right now, after we met, you and I, we're putting our two histories together and making something new. Right. And yes, we're using technology, we're using WI fi, we're using AI. But that's the beauty of this. And how to transmit these.</p>
<p>Maybe that's one of my thinking is to the young generations, because the guys that let's think that they went to college, they have some education and they are in the working area, maybe they're in their 30s, but they understand economy, they understand relationship, they understand education in different way that maybe I did in my background and that you did. So how that information. And another thing that maybe you are very used to, this is fake news.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:10:25</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:10:27</p>
<p>So maybe my mom or the older people, my next generation say, oh, I saw in Instagram or I saw in Facebook this. I say, mom, just because it's in Facebook or Instagram, it's not true. Yeah, right. But that mentality, how, how to screen what is a fake news.</p>
<p>And, and, and maybe what I will see in the future is going to your question, what really motivate me is how we connect more, is how we get more human connections in this sea or in this era of that we want to go everything digital.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:11:07</p>
<p>And I find your answer really encouraging and inspiring because I think the biggest impact of AI is to force us to ask the question, what does it mean to be human? Right. Who are we as human?</p>
<p>And I agree with you that especially in the context of aging, that the older I get, not only the more humble I become, but the more aware of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>And lately, because I live with animals, what it means to be an animal and to remember that as humans we have certain animal instincts and animal senses. But you said a couple of things I want to briefly respond to.</p>
<p>One is I was thinking about when I was younger and where I found wisdom and where I connected with my elders.</p>
<p>And I think it was easier then because there were different community centers, there were different spaces that were intergenerational that young people and old people would spend together. And I find we're losing that, that now, you know, people kind of gather amongst themselves.</p>
<p>So here in Canada, for example, we play a lot of ice hockey, we play a lot of curling. But you play with your age group, right. You don't really play with. You don't really have a lot of connections between old and young people.</p>
<p>And I think the mistake there is we're not allowing that learning to flow between young and old. And because both sides have much to teach each other.</p>
<p>And I think that's what makes the fake news thing so particularly difficult, is because we don't have that cross generational dialogue.</p>
<p>We don't have the people who understand history with the people who understand technology so that they can, you know, share notes and understand what's going on. And it makes us all kind of vulnerable. Although, interestingly enough, Rodolfo, here in Canada, Facebook and Instagram do not allow any news.</p>
<p>Like if I take an article from our public broadcaster and I try to post it on Facebook, Facebook, as a policy, doesn't allow it. But they do allow fake news. So you can post fake news on Facebook and you cannot post real news on Facebook, which is absurd. Wow. Right.</p>
<p>And it speaks to how you have to think for yourself. Right. You have to have very critical thinking in this regard.</p>
<p>Before we move on, is there any of that you wanted to respond to before I segue into our conversation about the poultry industry and global culture and what's going on in Latin America?</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:13:53</p>
<p>Well, the thing is, I just remember when you were talking about how you connect with your elders. Me, myself, I had the privilege to have a really nice connection with my mother in law. She used to live in San Francisco, I was living in Guatemala.</p>
<p>So when I was spending vacation with her, three months, four months, the complete school break. One of my best values in life is my connection with my grandmother. And that's something that I encourage to my kids.</p>
<p>Have a relationship with your, obviously your dad as much as we can, but with the grandfathers is something special.</p>
<p>Yeah, It's a different love, it's a different connection is something that, get this, I really believe in that the history of your elders is in your body. Yeah, yeah. It's something that carries from generation to generation.</p>
<p>So having the opportunity to have personal connection with your older elder alive is very unique.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:15:05</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. And important and something that people should prioritize and invest in. So let us, without any further delay, segue into our feature conversations.</p>
<p>That was our turkey prez coming into one of her roosts. So let's start with the poultry industry, only because it's partly how we met.</p>
<p>How did you first get involved either in poultry in particular or just in farming in general?</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:15:36</p>
<p>Hungry.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:15:37</p>
<p>Hungry.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:15:40</p>
<p>I was needed to feed three kids. No, the thing is. Yeah, I'm from Guatemala and I have an agriculture culture degree.</p>
<p>And long story short, I started working in a sugar cane company in Guatemala Sugarcane is very popular in Guatemala. But this family owned company, they used to have also a swine, a pork farm. And that's how I get involved in the animal.</p>
<p>So I get very actively involved, not just in the company, but in the association. So long story short, I became part of the National Boar Committee of Pork of Guatemala. And then I became the general manager of this association.</p>
<p>So that give me a. Provide me a lot of exposure to government, to taxes, to health campaigns, a lot of things from the associative perspective.</p>
<p>And then one company that I met in one show, they were needed to have one sales guy for Latin America for poultry equipment. So in those days I was needed to raise a family.</p>
<p>I didn't know anything about chickens, but I have in those days, what I had was passion and willingness. And then we're gonna come back to culture because Latin people, we have different chip and we can do a lot of things.</p>
<p>I don't know if I don't want to say it's good or bad, but it is what it is, right. I really appreciate people that are really focusing one subject and they become extra. And then you say, you can do this.</p>
<p>No, I'm not doing that because I'm expert on this and that's a really value. But maybe Latins, we can do a lot of things. We want to juggle so many things at the same time.</p>
<p>So the thing is that how I, that's how I get involved in the poultry industry. When this company hired me in 2006 to go after a market of products of equipments for the poultry industry in Latin America.</p>
<p>So I started knowing the big companies and going to shows and knowing the dynamics of the industry and give me.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:17:56</p>
<p>A sense of the size of the farms and the size of the farming operations that you'd be dealing with. Because I'm assuming there'd be quite a bit of diversity in terms of both really large farms and potentially really small farms.</p>
<p>As someone who is engaged in the sales side of equipment, who would you be dealing with? Who would you be kind of talking to and meeting?</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:18:19</p>
<p>Well, the thing is, that's a really good question. And that maybe goes to another question of our culture. Because for example, Tyson in Mexico. Tyson is already gone in Mexico.</p>
<p>Maybe they were looking to produce 1 million chickens weekly, right? So that was a very nice size. But you guys, you go to Brazil, you have another monsters. Maybe they can double and triple that size.</p>
<p>But then you have different layers in different countries. Maybe there are people that they just have ten houses, hundred houses.</p>
<p>So that's the unique thing of Latin America that you can find very strong companies like Cargill, Tyson. I don't know if you can say names here in this podcast. Sorry about that, I didn't ask.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:19:08</p>
<p>No, you can say whatever you want. Go ahead, it's okay.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:19:10</p>
<p>Okay. So the big players or integrators and then we have middle and small ones.</p>
<p>So I have the blessing and the capability that I was able to handle the big companies and also the very, very low profile companies. So that's the diversity in Latin America and in Mexico, let's say in the USA and Canada is different because they are more integrators.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:19:38</p>
<p>Well, and the other thing certainly here in Canada, in the United States is the cost. The cost to enter the agricultural market is very high. And that's why a lot of it is multi generational.</p>
<p>It's people who inherited it from their parents or their grandparents. Is that also the case in Latin America?</p>
<p>Or is poultry something that certainly for a small farmer is something or even pigs, is that something that they can start small and start to grow and is there that kind of smaller element compared to the more large industrial operations that you see in North America?</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:20:14</p>
<p>What I can see right now in maybe a standard in Latin America that the big companies are family owned or have so many years in the market.</p>
<p>And what I have been noticed is that the new players, they want to go like cage free, they want to go more clean productions because they are recognizing that there is a niche, there is a new market going away from the big companies.</p>
<p>And we need to say that, we need to say this also, that also the big companies, they protect themselves, they are seeing who is coming and maybe they have some ties with government taxes so that they protect their business. So in the bigger table, they know who is sitting in that table and they don't allow so many people in the top table.</p>
<p>So everybody can play down and do some things. But I think that is political, economic and so another energy sometimes. Yes.</p>
<p>What I this is what I think is, for example, the industry is like New York City. Okay? You go to Manhattan, Times Square, you see all the lights and everything is nice. And all the poultry industry is not is nice.</p>
<p>But the really driving elements of the industry, they are in the subway. In the subway there are no laws. They can beat you, they can rob you, they can stab you. So they really, really pull to industry. The dynamics.</p>
<p>They're in the subway. Everybody see all very nice ads, nice shows. You go to very nice shows. But they really, really what is going on is a Lot of dynamics in.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:22:08</p>
<p>The subway, which to your point, when I do have the privilege of being in New York, you have to take the subway because that's when you see the real city. That's when you sort of see the real character and the real life.</p>
<p>So let's transition this to your international experience because you sort of described your start in the industry and the opportunity you had to serve both the high end in terms of the large operations, but also experience the diversity of the smaller ones. But of course you've been able to work really all over the world. So let's start with the question of how did that happen?</p>
<p>At what point did you get the opportunity or did you get the conscious choice of saying, I'd like to experience different cultures and I'd like to see how different people handle, you know, the same agricultural practices, assuming they're the same, because maybe they're not.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:23:05</p>
<p>Well, the thing is that I sometimes I have been asking that question to myself, how I got the privilege and the opportunity to have been in so many places and farms, like you say, all over the world. And I believe also in my spiritual. And when I make this analysis is that maybe you have. Each person has their own chip.</p>
<p>What happens in their life, we're responsible. What happens to us, what we call coincidences, maybe they are not.</p>
<p>There is some spontaneous, let's say, management of what we'll do in the future, in our lives. So that's another discussion.</p>
<p>But the thing is, when I was in, in Guatemala working with this company that I was handling the market for chickens, for poultry, they say, oh, we have an opening and there is a big customer in Mexico. We want you to take very close service to those. So I went to live to Mexico. So for me there is a sense that I believe, yes.</p>
<p>That we talk in our first conversation is that feeling of curiosity, that feeling of closing chapters very quickly. One day, I was counting how many times I have been changing of home. Maybe 17, 18 times in my life. And sometimes I.</p>
<p>I'm saying this from my heart, is sometimes my life was packed in three suitcase. Right. Moving from one home to another. Right. So this activity is not for everybody.</p>
<p>It's not for something, oh, my home or my dinner table or my fridge. No, you, you need to rip your heart, you need to reap. It's like a. You are ending cycles very quickly in your life.</p>
<p>So this type of personalities, I don't know if they are common or not, but was me. So let's go to Mexico. To Mexico. I saw my furniture. I Saw everything. I, I hire a warehouse, I put everything with not knowing what was coming after.</p>
<p>But one of my drivers, one of my motivation was my kids. I can say that to provide them another vision, another perspective of life.</p>
<p>Something that opened their minds and let them know that what they have is not the only truth. That they were something different out there.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:25:47</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:25:48</p>
<p>So, so the first thing that we did is that we went to Mexico and shows that move was a different shock of culture. And when I say culture is first of all how we speak. Even that was Latin America. But how we eat.</p>
<p>One of the most valued things that I have, that I have in my experience is knowing the culture through your eating behaviors. What you eat, at what time do you eat? For example, if you go to Spain, they are starting having dinner like 10, 11 o'clock.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:26:20</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:26:21</p>
<p>And here in the US I'm having dinner 6, 6 or 6:30. Right. My neighbor say, yeah. Do you want to go out to dinner? Yeah. 5:30. Okay. In the afternoon. So, so. But you understand how the cultures go.</p>
<p>And then I went to China and, and, and, and basically going to. Your question is a. I was open the opportunities.</p>
<p>And another thing is you need to be ready something in your, in your energy that you need to keep the opportunities flowing. Like you and I talking today. You and I talking today is, is, is, is not casual.</p>
<p>Is because you are open and myself were open to explore new opportunities. Let's see what happened. Okay. And that's, that's one of my drivers to answer your questions.</p>
<p>How I went from Mexico to China, then I traveled all Asia, then I went to India.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:27:21</p>
<p>And just to be clear, was this I, I poultry or were you diversifying at all or taking on different roles?</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:27:30</p>
<p>Maybe 70, 80% my activity commercial is in poultry and then a little bit in swine also. I do some. I do. But mainly my expertise and my activity goes maybe I will say 70% poultry interacting with different areas right now.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:27:50</p>
<p>And I mean after China. Tell me more about some of the places that you lived and worked.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:27:54</p>
<p>Well, the thing is, after I went to Shanghai, but when you say China, the funny thing, I'm laughing because I think that everybody that start doing China, they have an impression of one idea what is China? But when you go there, and especially Shanghai is completely different energy.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:28:13</p>
<p>Well, and again, you have to remember as a Canadian, America has always been foreign to us.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I've spent enough time exploring America to know that every state is different, every city is different, every county is different.</p>
<p>And I would assume the same would be true of a country as old, as diverse and as cultured as China that the differences between urban and rural, between different states, between different regions would be tremendous.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:28:46</p>
<p>So yes, tremendous. And then in your question you say Latin America. I don't want to go deep about this because this is a sensitive issue.</p>
<p>It's about religion because Latin were very, let's say, let's say Christians Catholic or a Protestant. Right.</p>
<p>But Latin maybe right now is opening more, maybe in the last 10 years they have been more diversity that people is more open to different, let's say protocols or cultures. But in, in my time 10 years ago, the religion thing was still very tight.</p>
<p>So when you were thinking different people was staring at you and saying what you're doing, you need to follow these rules. Right?</p>
<p>And I'm saying this because when I arrived to China I find out that 1.7 billion people, they were not thinking or believing in my highest energy like me, I say what is going on here? But the people were nice, they were doing, they were, I was making a lot of connections.</p>
<p>So I say wow, this, this is an eye opening that what we think is the only true in the north side of the world is different. And then you are, you're asking me when I what other places I went.</p>
<p>So also they assigned me to go to India and India is another completely different animal. Water is not clean. They have a lot of homework in society.</p>
<p>Let's say change of food for example in India is still a lot they call the wet market for the chickens. They sell the chicken alive in the market and they kill it in front of you. And that's the reality there.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:30:40</p>
<p>Now in the case of both China and India, are you sort of representing or serving a large geography or just a particular region within these countries?</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:30:50</p>
<p>No, I was traveling because the companies that I used to work with, I was traveling all over India and all over China. But then my duty was a commercial thing obviously representing a company and providing solutions, equipment solutions.</p>
<p>But that gives me the opportunity to I, I still have very good friends in India. I still every Christmas or my birthday they chat me say Rolpo. And that's really the value that I have from those experience. Right.</p>
<p>So but the thing is after that, just to answer your question again after that they assigned me to go to what they call emi Europe, Africa and Middle East. So I was taking care of the dealership in all these places, Africa, Middle East.</p>
<p>So I was traveling to Russia, Turkey, Israel, Zambia and very quickly, one weekend was in one place, one, another weekend was another Place and the European Community. My shock really, I was based in Hungary, that was in 2016. So my colleagues, their fathers and their grandfathers, they experienced the war in Europe.</p>
<p>And you can feel in those countries still the sadness.</p>
<p>For example, if you go to Berlin, Germany, Berlin, all the museums are related to the war, all the tourist places, oh, here was the Wall, here is Checkpoint Charlie, here is the Nazis. So everything is related to the war. Something that we in this part of the world, we never experienced that.</p>
<p>So that opening for culture is completely different.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:32:43</p>
<p>And I mean, were you building a kind of, we're called meta views here? Were you building a kind of meta culture?</p>
<p>Because you're seeing all these different worlds and in particular, I think in seeing farmers and in meeting people who work in agriculture, you're really getting where people who live in the cities.</p>
<p>There might be a lot of similarity between someone in Shanghai and someone in London and someone in New York because they're wearing similar clothes and they're doing similar jobs. To what extent is agriculture culturally different?</p>
<p>And to where I was starting to formulate my question, Were you starting to pick up a kind of meta culture or Rodolfo's view of culture in general in terms of commonalities that transcend kind of individual locales or individual identities?</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:33:33</p>
<p>Well, the thing is. That's a really good question.</p>
<p>Yes, is the thing is my meta view, and I'm gonna use the word that you use when you open this conversation, is we are, we are humans. Mind if you are from China, from India, Zambia, Canadian, Guatemala, at the very bottom of our essence, we are humans.</p>
<p>And when you think in, in being human, there are like common laws, respect being seen, right? So I think that those words or the famous, I wouldn't say famous, but the thing is the misunderstood war that I think is love.</p>
<p>For example, when I say love, you immediately have an image or a perception according to your personal story or since you were born and all your experience, you have a concept what is love? But when I say love, I can say collaboration, support, help you being seen or just having a conversation.</p>
<p>If you go to a restaurant to people and you put your phone away, what another people feels doesn't matter if he's from Turkey, from Israel, from China.</p>
<p>So I understood that maybe you have different eating behaviors, you have different cultures, different holidays, but there are basic things that everybody feels that connection or we, we laughings.</p>
<p>If I think it's going to happen soon, if I met you person, I'm gonna give you a hug, I'm gonna say hello buddy, but maybe Americans are more just like this. Or some people, they just go into a room and say hello or just say just no, but us, we go everybody and shake hands.</p>
<p>So show another type of connections that, that maybe is something that we don't put attention much of that.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:35:45</p>
<p>Although you said earlier, you know how food is a big motivator and I think eating with people is also an important element of sharing culture.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:35:54</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:35:55</p>
<p>But. But you said something else that I want you to elaborate on.</p>
<p>Because the notion of being seen as an important aspect of being human and not just being human, but being belonging with other humans and being part of community. I'm not sure that North Americans understand that. And I say this on the one hand that North Americans clearly do everything they can to be seen.</p>
<p>I mean, in some cases they can be the biggest roosters in the entire flock. They are so desperate to be seen.</p>
<p>But I almost feel that the mistake we make in North America is we don't value how important it is for people to be seen. Like on the one hand, everyone's trying to be seen and they're doing everything they can, whether on Instagram or in real life, to get attention.</p>
<p>But I almost feel that we don't acknowledge the need and we're not generous with how we give people attention and allow people to be seen. And I think that is unique amongst North Americans compared to other cultures around the world.</p>
<p>Because I think other cultures around the world are far more likely to value their elders, are far more likely to recognize that there's a role for community as an entity versus North America has this very individualist kind of everyone for themselves. And as a result, I'm not sure that we do. Because when you said it, it was very self evident to me.</p>
<p>But then it also felt a little otherworldly, like I don't hear that enough. I need more people to say, yes, we all deserve to be seen, we all deserve to be heard.</p>
<p>Because I'm not sure that that is valued enough here in North America.</p>
<p>And I'd love to hear your thoughts on that and whether, you know, you think I'm identifying something or maybe I'm, I'm biased because I'm North American and perhaps a little bitter.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:37:59</p>
<p>No, I just. The first thoughts that that came into my mind is we need to define what, what is being seen.</p>
<p>And there is a feeling that a not judging you, you can be yourself.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:38:16</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:38:16</p>
<p>And I'm, I'm not going to judge you.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:38:18</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:38:19</p>
<p>And, and I think that so many times we wear a mask that we, we're trying to be somebody else just to fit into society.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:38:30</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:38:30</p>
<p>Into a pattern. And we forget to express our uniqueness. And when you have a relationship, let's put it in the industry or personal.</p>
<p>When you can express yourself really with the relief and say, oh, they're not gonna judge me or point me if I'm good or wrong. I think that that's the value of. Of being seen. Yeah, yeah, right. That.</p>
<p>That you can feel safe with somebody that say, I can tell you anything or I can. And put it into the. A working area, that you go to a meeting. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. If you are the CEO of.</p>
<p>You are in charge of the chickens that say, I can raise my hand and put this idea without being afraid of being judged, or say, why are you saying this? Or maybe this can be the best idea of the company.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:39:28</p>
<p>And I think that is an excellent way to describe it. And I think that's exactly the problem right now in North America, and in particular, I see young Americans who are terrified of being canceled.</p>
<p>They think if they say the wrong thing, they're going to be canceled. And a. They don't have anything that could be canceled. Right. They're young, they've got the whole world in front of them.</p>
<p>But it is this fear that they will be judged. It is this fear that no one will listen to them. So it's heartening for me to hear you describe that, and I think that allows us to kind of segue.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted to.</p>
<p>The reason I put Latin America up as one of the themes is whenever I speak to someone who lives elsewhere, not in Canada, I always want them to tell me more about what's happening locally.</p>
<p>But in particular, I think what you've been describing is a culture and a cultural shift that used to be very religious, that used to be very conservative, but is now starting to change, is now starting to evolve. Am I reading that correctly?</p>
<p>And give us a sense of sort of where you see contemporary Latin America, especially given how America under Trump is starting to change and starting to change its relationship with the world. I'm curious how you see Latin America responding or adapting or doing its own thing.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:40:57</p>
<p>Well, the thing is that with this new government, that because I'm living in the USA right now, I need to say this. That we have right now. Yes. At the end of the day, it's going to be ending in four years.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:41:08</p>
<p>I hope so. I make no assumptions.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:41:12</p>
<p>It's going to be changing. So the thing is, my thinking is we need to be responsible of our outcomes and our future, right?</p>
<p>And it's something that maybe Latin Americans already are doing that, owning their future, owning what is different, for example, when a lot of industry, Mexican industry for example, that I think is the big news right now of the commerce relationship is okay, we don't have the market of the usa, we're going to be looking in Europe, we're going to be looking in Asia.</p>
<p>Putting away that mentality that the only market is the USA for us here, maybe for example, all the avocados that come to the US mostly the majority are coming to Mexico. They are expensive. By the way, one avocado maybe is $3 or 250, something like that, a good avocado maybe in one month is going to be $354.</p>
<p>Some people will pay it you, some people will never know if they pay extra. But some people, they will say, no, I'm not gonna eat avocados or I'm gonna lower my, my supermarket budget, whatever.</p>
<p>But the thing is, is more what I think is that the Latins in some cases they have faster mind to adapt, to change game, to have another, let's say, outcome and invent something, something different.</p>
<p>So that's some of the capabilities that I think that this new generation, because what is going on right now, yes, this is my feeling is me, myself, let's say I'm 57, but these mix with the new generation. My kids are in the 30, 34, 5. They are in the, in the marketplace. But it's completely different generation.</p>
<p>It's a big change in this era that, that never happened before because we were steady. The white collars going to an office, the tradition, you go in the morning to an office, you come back home.</p>
<p>Maybe we need to talk another discussion about the, the woman role right now, not just in the industry, globally, the female energy and the female, let's say dynamics in the industry has changed dramatically in the last year. So that's another game, game changer that we can talk hours about that.</p>
<p>But talking about that, for example, me myself in poetry school, I have been offered and encouraged the doctors and the scientists to speak their knowledge, their work. They have something to share, right? For example, in poetry school I have the chance to work with very high end academics in the USA universities.</p>
<p>And one of the top guys that I will not share his name, he said, hey Rodolfo.</p>
<p>One of the most beautiful things that happened with me when I go to Latin America is learning from the people what they are doing, implementing things in the farm. Oh, they teach us to do this, but now we are, we find another way to do it. But nobody shared that.</p>
<p>Maybe channels or proposals that you have and I have is we need to spread that news because there are so many ideas, so many game changer things that can make an impact, but the people doesn't believe in themselves that this can be done. Why?</p>
<p>Because maybe the fear of being judged, maybe the fear of not saying, oh, this is going to be a stupid idea or not, no, I will keep it for me, but maybe it's the winner idea.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:45:28</p>
<p>Well, and to your point, I learned so much from other farmers around the world who are just sharing their ideas, who are sharing their innovation, who are sharing their inventions. And they're doing it partly because they want to be seen, partly because they want to make connections.</p>
<p>And it's kind of similar to your own story that they enjoy meeting people, they enjoy connecting with people, they enjoy sharing their passion.</p>
<p>I mean, to that point, when I asked you earlier in the episode about the future, you answered the question, I think quite appropriately in that you were describing our collective future and your own hopes within it. But you just inspired a kind of closing question of what's your future?</p>
<p>You are clearly someone who enjoys learning, who enjoys sharing, who enjoys meeting people. We are all aging, right? And we all kind of slow down as we age.</p>
<p>You don't seem to be slowing down like you seem to still have, you know, as the French would say, a joie de vivre. Where do you see your future? I mean, it seems like you, as long as you're learning, as long as you're sharing and doing, you're happy.</p>
<p>So, you know, what's your. I'll give you an either or either. What's your prescription for happiness? Or more specifically, how do you see yourself aging?</p>
<p>How do you see yourself carrying yourself in the next 20, 30, hey, maybe 40 years?</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:46:58</p>
<p>Well, the thing is, you make so many questions in one question. Okay, the what is the formula of happiness? Or what is or what?</p>
<p>You see this energy that I think is part of what you're saying, and even that I'm 57, that's one part of the culture thing. In my culture, being 57 seems like you are done, that you are older enough, right. That you need to be retiring soon.</p>
<p>I don't know, what is the word retire? Because in my mind is not such a thing that I'm. Because for me, I'm trying to change the world. Working for, providing, connecting.</p>
<p>And that's gonna be forever, right? Even though when I pass away, I have the belief that it's just gonna be a transition. But the thing is how I see myself in the future.</p>
<p>I know that I have been doing my living in the poultry industry for the past 25 years knowing people all around the world. I can say that my more highest value is knowing people. I was talking to Claudia, my wife, for example, just measuring buckets.</p>
<p>The new connections that I have in the last month, including you, they're amazing new people that just bring to my life new energy, new opportunities, new way of connections, new way of doing things together, inventing new proposal to the society. And obviously my main, let's say community is the poultry industry.</p>
<p>But how I see myself and I have this very focus is the message that I want to send to my community and every person that I met is go back to yourself. Go and believe in yourself. Find your true purpose. Find your true identity. You are in the chicken industry, do it in that way.</p>
<p>You are a carpenter, do it in that way. You are a musician, do it in that way. But I really believe that my purpose is because I'm experiencing. I'm.</p>
<p>I'm living in these 50 trillion cells that they have a power and energy and is something inside me that want to express in some unique way there is no other me or other you in the complete existence and say wow, I need to use this. I need to keep full of energy and making connections and, and, and with what. What we do in poetry school is putting education.</p>
<p>But what is education is. You have a value, you have a concept. Share it. Don't, don't, don't keep it is in medicine, is in vaccines, is in ventilation, is in feeding.</p>
<p>Whatever subject you are expert, right? What I really love, what I do in my webinars, educational webinars, Maybe is the 10, 15 minutes out of camera that I connect with the people.</p>
<p>Hey, how are you? What you doing? And we laugh a little bit. That connection is really what really is, is my purpose, right?</p>
<p>So to answer your question, for me, happiness is. Is putting attention to the most important relationship that is yourself and, and is inside you. Is finding that uniqueness doesn't.</p>
<p>Caring about what the neighbor is going to say about you is some something that you cannot describe. I just put the word love before that. Experiencing love for me to be genuine and profound. You cannot explain it in words.</p>
<p>If you can explain love in words, you are not experiencing something spectacular. Right? So that's maybe the channel that I have had in my career, okay, the poetry industry knowledge.</p>
<p>But at the end of the knowledge, at the end of the day Knowledge is sharing your value, sharing your identity with an open community. That's what I really believe today is in making connections to create a better world, a better community.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:51:32</p>
<p>And I've heard a great saying which is that knowledge increases in value the more that it is shared, that it is inherently designed to be shared. Now we end every mediview segment with what we call our shout outs.</p>
<p>And our shout outs really is just an acknowledgement that we exist in community, we learn from others. Now here, Rodolfo, I'm asking you for one shout out.</p>
<p>I've had guests in the past who I asked them to do a shout out and they then went on for 15 minutes naming every single person they've ever read or met in their entire life. In your case, that would be another hour.</p>
<p>So is there one person, living or dead, real or fictional, who you think our audience should know more about?</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:52:20</p>
<p>Well, the, the thing is there are persons that really I need to shout out. But if I want to share somebody that people can reach, somebody that is really make a difference in me is a guy called Mark Gaffney.</p>
<p>I want to say, just to put it in that way, I came from Latin, but if you are start knowing me, I'm very curious. So I was very deep in religion and where the religion come from. They say we have a bible, but where the bible come from.</p>
<p>Those guys didn't have a bible when they were saying oh I met God and what is God is energy, blah blah. So I was very curious so I went to the very, very, very, let's say origins where the Bible come from.</p>
<p>So I learned about Kabbalah, I learned try to study a Jewish traditions. So I a curious and then I found this guy called Mark Gaffney that he make a link between all these energy, what we call love.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:53:36</p>
<p>Right on.</p>
<p>Rodolfo Arreaga 00:53:37</p>
<p>And then when you make that connections and you take away all the fake news that your society put in your head about love and how we connect. Wow. Once again it's like they provide me a new glasses.</p>
<p>So I see life, I see life different and then that energy that live in us, that provides us energy and creation going inside you. It's inside you. It's not outside. Yeah, it's inside you start breathing differently.</p>
<p>Jesse Hirsh 00:54:16</p>
<p>Yes, you start living differently. And you know Rodolfo, I have to thank you very much.</p>
<p>And you started this conversation by pointing out that when you reached out you're like hey, can we have a conversation? And I said no, I'll ask Google. Because when I have a conversation with people I want it to be like this. I want it to be free flowing.</p>
<p>I wanted to talk about love. I wanted to talk about culture, about work, about ideas, about innovation. This is what life is about. This is what being human is about.</p>
<p>So thank you Rodolfo. I am very grateful. This has been another episode of Metaviews. A fantastic episode, if I don't mind saying.</p>
<p>Metaviews is available on all the socials, on all the podcasting platforms. Maybe you're watching this right now on YouTube, in which case you should hit that thumbs up and subscribe. But we'll be back soon.</p>
<p>Probably not with as good an episode as we had today, but you never know. Crazy things happen. But thanks again and we'll see everybody soon.</p>
