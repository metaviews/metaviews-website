<p>In this episode of Metaviews, Jesse Hirsh is joined by technologist and thinker Russell McOrmand for a wide-ranging conversation that dismantles the myth of &quot;human nature&quot; and exposes the lingering shadows of eugenics in modern institutions. Together, they explore how corporate culture has infested political discourse, reducing democracy to a sport and sidelining long-term thinking in favor of short-term spectacle.</p>
<p>What would it mean to think seven generations ahead? What role could neurodivergent individuals play in building better futures? And how might we imagine a news service designed by and for neurodivergent people—one that prioritizes clarity, complexity, and care over clickbait?</p>
<p>From systemic critique to visionary alternatives, this episode offers a radical reframing of where we are—and where we could go.</p>
