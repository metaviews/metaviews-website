<p>The pandemic has transformed work and learning, and this will be</p>
<p>particularly evident as we emerge into a post-pandemic world. One</p>
<p>person’s disruption is another person’s opportunity. Similarly some</p>
<p>organizations have responded with incredible resilience, and are</p>
<p>experiencing unprecedented growth and success.</p>
<p>Historically great crises and catastrophes are followed by renaissances</p>
<p>and periods of incredible innovation. What’s the difference between</p>
<p>success and failure, between depression and excitement? Talent. This is</p>
<p>true for both individuals and organizations.</p>
<p>How do you foster and harness your talent? How do organizations attract,</p>
<p>develop, and retain talent? These are crucial questions during this</p>
<p>transitional period as we remain in a pandemic but seek our path out of</p>
<p>it!</p>
