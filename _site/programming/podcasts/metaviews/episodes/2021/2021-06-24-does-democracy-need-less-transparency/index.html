<p>Transparency is becoming an easy go to as a solution to almost any problem of the algorithmic era. Given the phrase “black box society” this is understandable, as so much of our world is opaque or secretive, that there is a natural desire for more access and scrutiny.</p>
<p>Yet in this rush to champion transparency, are we using a broad brush when greater nuance is necessary?</p>
<p>For example, personal privacy is essential, but what about corporate privacy or secrecy? Privacy for the individual and transparency for the corporation seems like a sensible balance. Unfortunately we currently have the opposite.</p>
<p>What about government however? Should we afford our governments and politicians similar nuance?</p>
<p>James G D’Angelo thinks so. He argues that the impact of transparency on politics has been disastrous. That much of the polarization and sensationalism of politics can be traced back to laws that force greater scrutiny of the minutiae of policy development and politicking.</p>
