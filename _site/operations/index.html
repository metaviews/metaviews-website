<h1>Operations</h1>

<p>
  We take seriously Marshall McLuhan’s insight that everything is media.
  Environments communicate. Systems teach. The ways we organize food, land,
  labour, technology, and attention all shape what can be known and how people
  learn. Our operations are therefore designed as living research
  environments—places where practice, observation, and media production collapse
  into one another.
</p>
<p>
  <a href=https://impossible.ws>The Academy of the Impossible</a> is the name we give to our farm-based work in
  agroecology. It is not a retreat from media, but an expansion of it. Soil
  health, animal care, energy systems, and food production are treated as forms
  of literacy—ways of learning how power, dependency, resilience, and care
  actually function. This work grows out of earlier literacy initiatives in
  Toronto, where Metaviews focused on helping people make critical media. The farm extends that project into the material world, where
  feedback is immediate and abstraction is grounded in the day to day.
</p>
<p>
  Alongside agroecology, Metaviews operates as an intelligence practice. Our
  research, analysis, and archival work sit beside our podcasts, essays, and
  public conversations as part of the same operational loop. Media production is
  not separate from research, and research is not separate from how we live.
  Intelligence is generated through sustained engagement with
  environments—political, technological, ecological—and then shared as a commons
  through durable publishing and dialogue.
</p>
<p>
  In this sense, operations are where Metaviews thinks out loud. The farm, the
  studio, and the intelligence network are one system. Each informs the other. All are media.
