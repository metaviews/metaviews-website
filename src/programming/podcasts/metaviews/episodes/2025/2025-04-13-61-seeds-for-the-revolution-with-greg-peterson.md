In this episode of *Metaviews*, agroecologist **Jeanette Herrle** sits down with **Greg Peterson**, from [UrbanFarm.org](https://www.urbanfarm.org), for a conversation about growing food as a radical act of autonomy and resistance.

Together they explore how seeds—both literal and metaphorical—can serve as catalysts for systemic change. From backyard gardens to urban food forests, from mutual aid to microbial soil life, this dialogue connects personal action with planetary transformation.

What does it mean to cultivate revolution in the soil beneath our feet? How can urban agriculture rewire our relationship with land, labour, and local governance? And what role do education, resilience, and seed sovereignty play in reimagining our food systems?

Jeanette and Greg share practical strategies and powerful stories from the front lines of the food sovereignty movement—challenging extractive models and offering hopeful alternatives rooted in care, community, and regeneration.

**Keywords:** food sovereignty, agroecology, urban farming, regenerative agriculture, seed saving, mutual aid, climate resilience, system change, gardening as resistance, local food systems
