Hello, I'm Jesse Hirsch and welcome to Metaviews, a show about the big picture, about the future, about our role in it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:14

And today, well, we've got a blockbuster, the future of storytelling, which, you know, is a subject we've certainly dealt with a lot here on Meta Views because we love the intersection of technology and entertainment and creativity.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:33

But I'm particularly happy about our guest today, in no small part, Eric, because you're the first guest I've had who combines my two favorite topics, which is public broadcasting and generative AI.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:48

Even though they're distinct.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:49

I'm not saying that we're talking about them together, but as two polls, they're something I'm quite fascinated with.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:56

But Eric, we start every show here on Metaviews by kind of doing the age old media tradition of the news.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:06

And this is partly because Metaviews publishes a daily newsletter.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:11

And our episode today gets into some fascinating research around Cambodia and the way in which Cambodia has become a kind of, dare I say it, center of excellence when it comes to cybercrime, that they've created a kind of infrastructure that allows scammers to launder their money to really facilitate those exchanges.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:34

So this was originally reported by Wired magazine yesterday, and I sort of picked it up to share with some of my folks.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:42

But Eric, our news segment really is meant to be an opportunity for our guests to share any news that they would like our audience to know.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:52

This could be personal news, this could be world news.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:56

Look, it could be fake news as long as you disclose it ahead of time.

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:00

But it's really meant to have our guests share their perspective with our audience and what they're thinking about, what they're reading, what they're keeping an eye on in the event horizon.

Eric 00:02:13

Well, my mind goes straight to just all the tools that I'm tracking.

Eric 00:02:19

I'm really focused on all of the image generation and video generation tools that are coming out.

Eric 00:02:28

And it can be sort of tricky to decipher what's news versus just today's flashy thing.

Eric 00:02:37

But I'm.

Eric 00:02:38

I'm definitely seeing deep Google DeepMind's.

Eric 00:02:43

I think it's.

Eric 00:02:44

VO2 is looking like a real step ahead in this whole thing.

Eric 00:02:50

I've had a chance now to use Sora a little bit and that was sort of a letdown, I think, in a lot of ways.

Eric 00:02:56

Although there's some really interesting parts of it.

Eric 00:02:59

I think VO2 looks really interesting in terms of the realism and the movement and the shot length.

Eric 00:03:06

And I think that's going to really, when the public has access to that will really take all of this visual storytelling that we've been seeing over the past 18 months or so and level it all up.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:19

Well, and I think this is a great news story because this is a subject I'm following closely as well.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:25

And as you noted, what I sometimes struggle with is I need to play with these things to really get a sense of whether the hype is real or whether it's not yet ready for prime time.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:36

I felt the same way about Sora in the sense that it couldn't live up to my imagination, it couldn't live up to kind of what I wanted to get out of it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:44

But we may get into this later when we talk about generative AI.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:48

But as a follow up question, it does seem like Google is really picking up the pace here and that they've been releasing tools.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:57

I love their Google Notebook, which I call a custom podcast engine, where OpenAI and anthropic were, I think, real leaders last year.

Jesse Hirsch 00:04:09

It really feels like Google's got this momentum and they're going to really cause a lot of attention.

Jesse Hirsch 00:04:15

And I'm curious your thoughts on that in terms of the, the industry players and them jockeying for position.

Eric 00:04:21

Yeah, I mean it's, it's, it's going to certainly be a fascinating thing to watch.

Eric 00:04:26

I mean the amount of money these companies are pouring in to AI and all of the research and technology, I mean it's going to be, there's going to just be, it's going to be leapfrog of, of wild proportions I think for the next while, while they keep having their own breakthroughs and they're focused in different areas and things.

Eric 00:04:46

And you know, Google as a endless piggy bank, you know, I don't know what kind of numbers they're investing, but I'm sure it's staggering.

Eric 00:04:56

So it's really not that big of a surprise in that sense that they caught up so quickly.

Eric 00:05:01

Imagine whatever they point at.

Eric 00:05:02

They, you know, they hit pretty quickly.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:05

Well, and, and to your point about the significant resources, it strikes me the differential is going to be in, in the products, in the user experience, in the capabilities.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:16

And that's where Google does have a mixed record.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:18

They've got some major blockbuster successes, but they're littered with all sorts of failures from Google.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:26

Circle was their social media platform.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:28

I remember that had huge hype and they put a lot of resources into it and they still couldn't really get it off the ground.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:37

I think to your point, this is a fascinating time to be in the media industry, to be in the creative industries and to be looking at how these tools play out.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:45

Which relatedly brings us to our next segment, which we call WTF or what's the Future?

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:56

And this is our opportunity as a future centric podcast to ask our guest, is there something about the future that you've got your eyes on, that you're looking forward to that in your own kind of prognostication that you would like our audience to be thinking about when.

Jesse Hirsch 00:06:14

When they're looking, you know, forward at what's to come and what they should be preparing for?

Eric 00:06:19

Yeah, well, I'm particularly excited about the surplus creativity that I will unlock because, you know, I went to college to study film.

Eric 00:06:30

I got a film studies degree, and I've been lucky to stay, you know, adjacent to the filmmaking industry and be able to sort of work intelligence, be creative and use cameras and stuff.

Eric 00:06:41

So that's all been great, but kind of let go of the idea that I would ever make a film until recently, and now it feels like, wow, I can.

Eric 00:06:50

I don't need permission.

Eric 00:06:51

I have the tools.

Eric 00:06:53

This is incredible.

Eric 00:06:54

And while they may not be there all the way, it's pretty clear that they're coming.

Eric 00:06:58

And so, you know, that's as true for me as it is for anyone anywhere now with a few subscriptions.

Eric 00:07:04

And so if you've ever thought of yourself as a storyteller or a creator that just didn't have the access to the big cities or the whatever, I don't think that's required anymore.

Eric 00:07:15

And the permission certainly isn't required anymore either.

Eric 00:07:18

So that's really exciting to me to just think that that dream is within reach for so many aspiring creatives.

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:25

Yeah, 100%.

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:26

And that is, I think, what we're going to unpack later in this episode, because I agree, I think it's revolutionary.

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:34

And I say this because I'm of a vintage where I remember, like, I remember when I first got WordPerfect and I could put out a newspaper, and I thought that was crazy.

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:43

Let alone radio and television, which was so prohibitive, so expensive, and they would filter out crazy people like me, so there wouldn't even be that opportunity versus, you're right now anyone could make a potentially the next blockbuster, or at least the next kind of underground cult classic.

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:59

And.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:00

And I'm absolutely excited by the potential.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:03

So we are absolutely going to talk about that.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:06

But before we do, you know, I break up each episode into different segments, and our features usually revolve around ideas that I want to talk about.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:18

With the guest and mine with the guest.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:20

And when I was researching you and looking you up, I saw that in addition to, you know, your background in TV production and in all sorts of media, you're currently affiliated with what I would call a, you know, community public broadcasting.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:37

And I've always been a huge fan of public broadcasting.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:41

You know, here in Canada we have the CBC which is obviously smaller than the BBC, but it has a huge influence in our media landscape, especially now our digital media landscape and where I personally have some issues with how CBC has adapted to the digital age.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:59

And they've been very risk averse and conservative and me being someone who's the opposite right, trying to push them in that direction.

Jesse Hirsch 00:09:08

But I've always believed that public broadcasting has a fundamental role in a democratic society.

Jesse Hirsch 00:09:14

It has a way of allowing greater voices, greater experimentation, different programming ideas.

Jesse Hirsch 00:09:22

So I got a two parter for you.

Jesse Hirsch 00:09:25

How did you get into public broadcasting?

Jesse Hirsch 00:09:28

What was your intro, your relationship and what are you doing now?

Jesse Hirsch 00:09:33

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:09:34

Tell me more about the role that you're playing and the organization in which you're doing it with.

Eric 00:09:39

Yeah, it's become a major part of my life.

Eric 00:09:44

I after school went to New York to get into like commercial television and I did that for five years and was doing a lot of sports and music and reality stuff and then went out to LA and was trying to do big studio stuff and did that for a couple of years.

Eric 00:09:59

But then it was, I got to a point in my life with my now wife where we, we were settling down in Los Angeles and wanted, we're both from the east coast.

Eric 00:10:13

And so it was time to make that decision about where we were going to put down roots, raise a family and that sort of thing.

Eric 00:10:23

And so we moved back to Massachusetts for non work reasons for me.

Eric 00:10:26

And it was, it was a difficult choice because it was not a career move at all.

Eric 00:10:31

It was the opposite.

Eric 00:10:32

I was leaving producing for NBC to come back to my hometown in Massachusetts with no prospects and you know, started painting fences and taking the real estate exam, thinking it was all over and saw an opportunity in the cable access industry for this one community.

Eric 00:10:50

They wanted a full time producer to create original content about their community with health and benefits.

Eric 00:10:55

And I was like, please give me this job right on thing to do at the time with its mission or values or any of that.

Eric 00:11:05

It was just a lifesaver, a career saver for me.

Eric 00:11:10

And then I got to do that for three years and start to really gain an understanding of the value of community media and get it be like, oh, okay, now I see what this is all about.

Eric 00:11:21

And then a few years later, I had the opportunity to take over one of those stations as the executive director very close to where I grew up.

Eric 00:11:29

And so it was a real coming home for me and felt like, oh, this is it.

Eric 00:11:34

And so for the last almost 12 years, I've been running a small, nonprofit regional community media TV station.

Eric 00:11:41

And it's this great little brick and mortar place that is fighting for relevance and trying to do cool things and punch above its weight class, but also do all the real fundamental community things like municipal meeting coverage, community events, community member forum shows, things like that.

Eric 00:12:01

But we also do a lot of original content now, and we're a real evolution up from the old days.

Eric 00:12:08

We've rebranded, of course, and we're doing all kinds of fun stuff now.

Eric 00:12:12

So it's been a really wonderful challenge to try to build that up all on the back of content and creativity.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:20

Right on.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:21

And I want to kind of bridge public broadcasting into generative AI in a moment, but before that, because we do talk about politics and policy on this show.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:30

Do you have any concerns about what may happen to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting?

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:36

And I don't know if your funding is tied to that particular apparatus, but it does feel, certainly from what I hear on npr, that this is a real moment to defend public broadcasting in the United States.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:50

As you were arguing, as a pillar of the community.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:52

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:53

As a place for citizens to be informed about local politics and local matters.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:58

Is this a concern of yours as an executive director?

Eric 00:13:02

Huge concern, yeah.

Eric 00:13:03

Among all of the leaders in our industry.

Eric 00:13:05

It's something we talk about all the time and advocate for and try to work on legislation for.

Eric 00:13:12

There are a number of threats that are putting our industry in peril, cord cutting being the main one.

Eric 00:13:20

You know, everyone moving to streaming from cable moves funding from us, away from us because we, we get funded by a percentage of cable subscription revenue within the community we serve.

Eric 00:13:34

So as people do that, where our funding declines.

Eric 00:13:37

But then there's also sort of the, the political headwinds that change things.

Eric 00:13:42

And FCC chairs, you know, different parties have different feelings about, about our industry.

Eric 00:13:49

And, and certainly the incoming administration does not seem to be a big proponent of it.

Eric 00:13:56

I've read some very concerning things about their opinions of it.

Eric 00:14:00

And fortunately, we have great groups like the alliance for Community Media and Mass Access and groups like that here that advocate for us, and they do a great job so keeping us all up to speed on that.

Eric 00:14:11

But yeah, it's, it's it's existential crisis, period.

Eric 00:14:16

Absolutely right on.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:17

And this is where I'd say if you ever need any international allies, there are a lot of Canadians who really support public broadcasting.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:26

And I think if you think about politics as being a social media participation exercise, there'd probably be a lot of people who'd be boosting that signal.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:35

So just putting it out there to the larger fans of public broadcasting in general.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:40

And while I do want to get into the nuts and bolts of generative AI in to some of the big issues, I kind of feel an interesting bridge.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:48

Do you have any thoughts around how generative AI could be used in public broadcasting?

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:53

And I say this both in terms of the resource constraints that all public broadcasters have to deal with, but also what I'm sure we're going to get into, which is the creative potential, especially from the point of accessibility, which is kind of again, the ethos of where community media public broadcasting got its start.

Eric 00:15:14

Yeah, well, it was really with my executive director hat on that I got excited about AI first.

Eric 00:15:20

And it was the resource gain that you alluded to because we're resource starved.

Eric 00:15:27

And if most non profits are, that's sort of a standard operating standard operating for non profits.

Eric 00:15:34

You know, you're fighting for every penny.

Eric 00:15:35

And so when it was clear that chat GPT and mid journey were going to be useful to me, it was like, oh, all right, awesome.

Eric 00:15:42

Let's, let's learn more about this.

Eric 00:15:45

And so I've spent a lot of time over the past year and a half or so thinking about how AI could impact our industry support it.

Eric 00:15:54

You know, as I said, we're in a major crisis and we needed a solution that was major also.

Eric 00:16:01

And maybe AI is that size solution.

Eric 00:16:05

I mean it has that feeling that it could be the transformative.

Eric 00:16:09

Right.

Eric 00:16:09

So like I am excited about it, even if we haven't figured out exactly all the ways yet.

Eric 00:16:14

It's like here's this big resource tool thing and let's, let's learn about it.

Eric 00:16:20

So I'm looking at automations for our operations.

Eric 00:16:24

We have chat GPT for teams trying to figure out GPTs we can make and use that really help us out.

Eric 00:16:31

And it's changing production workflows a lot.

Eric 00:16:34

You know, when you can quickly transcribe things and edit from transcriptions now and all these new tools are making things faster within a lot of the tools we already use like Canva or Premiere or Photoshop or whatever it might be.

Eric 00:16:49

So it's not necessarily massive transformational changes yet.

Eric 00:16:54

It's a lot of just like let's just clean up a lot of the inefficiencies for now because there's huge wins when you start stacking those right on.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:03

And I mean I'll say certainly from my own experience, I started podcasting again not because I have any excess of time, quite the opposite it but because the tools have streamlined the process.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:13

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:13

And they make it easier for me to focus on like conversations we're having now rather than the kind of back end production which in having that automated I I think that's incredibly empowering.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:25

I I'm also curious, is there any dialogue within public broadcasting kind of associations or larger communities around best practices and shared tips?

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:35

Like is there a kind of collaborative culture within the US kind of community media ecosystem?

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:42

That's kind of.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:43

Because to your point, it is an experiment on the fly.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:46

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:47

And I think public broadcasting and community media have their own distinct needs compared to other forms of media industry.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:56

Is there any collaboration, cooperation, dialogue happening that you're aware of or engaged in?

Eric 00:18:03

There is.

Eric 00:18:03

Yeah.

Eric 00:18:04

I just spoke at the alliance for Communities East Coast Conference in Mystic, Connecticut just a few weeks ago on the topic, actually showing executive directors how I use AI for my work.

Eric 00:18:19

And I'm going to be hopefully doing that again at the their next conference is going to be in Boston where I live.

Eric 00:18:28

So.

Eric 00:18:29

Right on going to be doing that again soon.

Eric 00:18:31

And we have forums and things online.

Eric 00:18:35

We're always sharing tips and things.

Eric 00:18:37

So yeah, absolutely.

Jesse Hirsch 00:18:39

Very cool.

Jesse Hirsch 00:18:41

Because without stating the obvious, you know, you're clearly at the forefront and it's important that you know many of the other I say this from my own experience.

Jesse Hirsch 00:18:50

A lot of public broadcasters are risk averse and they need to get access to success stories and case examples for them to adopt this stuff.

Jesse Hirsch 00:18:58

So let's transition to generative AI in general.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:01

We've been sort of teasing it and kind of going around it, but it has a lot of substantive issues to it and without itemizing them, I'm going to throw you a bit of a curveball, which I expect you're still going to knock right out of the park.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:16

How do you deal with some of the people who not so much are naysayers or critics, but are straight out prejudicial and discriminatory?

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:26

And I say this because I see this, I see this really kind of stupid frame on social media a lot, which is it's just dumb or it's just dumb because of X versus to me it's far more nuanced.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:38

And while there are Kind of legitimate issues.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:41

I'm kind of curious as someone who has your level of media literacy and your level of kind of proficiency with the tools, how you deal with those sorts of folks.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:50

Like what is your kind of argument as to why this is worth their, their time and their attention?

Eric 00:19:56

Yeah, I guess one kind of recent example comes to mind where I was giving a talk at a senior center of all places about AI and there was a gentleman in the room who raised his hand relatively early and was like, you know, I had a family member who had AI pornographic pictures with her face on them and was bullied.

Eric 00:20:21

It was just like horrible story about.

Eric 00:20:26

It represented why he was anti AI basically because he had had this first hand experience or secondhand experience that was very negative.

Eric 00:20:35

And so that's where he was starting from.

Eric 00:20:38

He was coming in a little bit angry and kind of wanted me to sort of answer for that in a way.

Eric 00:20:46

And it was like, well, you know, that's, that's obviously, there's obviously lots to worry about that I completely understand with AI.

Eric 00:20:56

I mean I share a lot of those concerns.

Eric 00:20:59

They're valid.

Eric 00:21:00

And I think I'm accustomed to people struggling with change of any kind, so I get that too.

Eric 00:21:07

Like it's, you know, and if you're sensing this shift and you're not super tech savvy, I'm sure that's very uncomfortable.

Eric 00:21:16

And so I, I get it.

Eric 00:21:17

You know, I don't really have any feelings, negative feelings towards people who are real, very anti at this point because it makes sense to me.

Eric 00:21:26

But later in that talk with that gentleman, I was like, you know, let's, I was, this was a while ago, so I was, I think I was just showing off chat GPT and perplexity and stuff.

Eric 00:21:38

And I was like, let's just see if there's a use case for you.

Eric 00:21:42

And he actually had a, a dog with him.

Eric 00:21:48

Like a, like a, what do you call like a medical service dog.

Eric 00:21:52

Service dog.

Eric 00:21:53

Thank you.

Eric 00:21:53

He had a service dog with him and he's like, well so I just started asking about his life and I brought up the dog and he's like, well, you know, I, one of the concerns I have is I'm trying to retire my service dog and I don't want it to have separation anxiety.

Eric 00:22:07

I don't know how to do it.

Eric 00:22:09

I'm nervous about, you know, so I pull a perplexity and I literally just prompted what he said.

Eric 00:22:14

I'm trying to retire my service dog.

Eric 00:22:16

I don't know what to do.

Eric 00:22:18

And of Course I had like a step plan for him and we did some deeper dives into some of the things he was like tearing up by the end.

Eric 00:22:26

I emailed him the whole thing on the spot.

Eric 00:22:28

It was just like, I think you just need your own use case.

Jesse Hirsch 00:22:31

Yeah.

Eric 00:22:32

You know, because this is a general purpose tool and we all have general needs and questions and things and these tools are incredible for helping us with anything.

Eric 00:22:44

So, you know, it's just a little bit of a nudge toward like what, what matters to them, I think, and it will open the door that will open more and more as they get comfortable, that it's not all terrifying.

Eric 00:22:55

There's a lot of useful, non scary stuff there.

Jesse Hirsch 00:22:58

Well, and, and you alluded to it before that with these tools you kind of have to use them to understand them.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:04

And I've always felt that way about the Internet in general, that it's a participatory media, that in order to really understand its benefits, you have to play with it, you have to experiment.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:14

And certainly I feel that's very much the case with AI.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:19

As a researcher, I was following it really from its earliest inceptions and initially I resisted playing with the tools because I'm a huge climate change proponent.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:33

I shouldn't say proponent.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:34

I'm not in favor of it, but I'm very conscious of it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:36

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:36

It's part of why I'm a farmer and why I'm into alternate tech and green tech.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:41

But then once I kind of understood the copyright dynamics of what was happening, I decided I didn't want to sit this one out, that if this was the redefinition of Fair use as we know it, or if this was the redefinition of how copyright can be remixed or remashed up, I thought, no, this is a really cultural, a cultural moment that I want to be part of.

Jesse Hirsch 00:24:06

So I'm curious, as someone who has a background in the cultural industries, who has a background in the media industry, where you fall on the whole copyright issue, which is clearly an unresolved debate for lots of different reasons, but certainly for creative types, for them it can be a big turnoff.

Jesse Hirsch 00:24:25

And it's something that I've often, you know, been frustrated by them.

Jesse Hirsch 00:24:31

You're saying, well, no, this, this isn't going to work, it's going to violate copyright versus again, I feel there's more nuance there that it's not so clear cut.

Jesse Hirsch 00:24:39

So I'm curious how you approach or address those concerns.

Eric 00:24:45

Well, I'm very familiar with working in Fair Use all the Time in from my public media days, we're always trying to sort of like beg, borrow, and steal for assets.

Eric 00:24:57

You know, steal like an artist is something you might hear once in a while.

Eric 00:25:04

You know, it's just we're always sort of, Is this okay?

Eric 00:25:09

You know, it's a remit, and fair use is a very, like, case by case type of thing.

Eric 00:25:14

And playing with a lot of the image generation tools, I.

Eric 00:25:17

I find myself wondering about, is this fair use?

Eric 00:25:21

This is so new, you know, I'll give you an example.

Eric 00:25:25

I had to make a.

Eric 00:25:28

An ad using AI recently for a company, and I was trying to generate a certain look, and I remembered a magazine, I remembered a Vanity Fair cover with the Game of Thrones cast shot by Anna.

Eric 00:25:46

Annie.

Jesse Hirsch 00:25:47

Annie Leibovitz.

Jesse Hirsch 00:25:47

Yeah, I remember that.

Eric 00:25:48

And I was like, okay, that's kind of the look I want.

Eric 00:25:51

So I found the picture and I.

Eric 00:25:55

I don't remember the exact process, but I essentially was able to ingest the photo.

Eric 00:26:00

And then like, I.

Eric 00:26:02

What I could have done is say, okay, mid journey, describe this photo.

Eric 00:26:06

And then it would describe it.

Eric 00:26:08

And then I could say, okay, well generate that description and it would generate something else, right, Similar.

Eric 00:26:14

And then it's like, okay, well maybe describe that aesthetic or something, and then.

Eric 00:26:20

Or use it as a style reference for my prompt about the image that I want.

Eric 00:26:26

And then I would do, like, I'd get some images and then do versions of those images, and then, you know, maybe even some more effects and things like that.

Eric 00:26:37

And by the end, if you can tell me what photo I stole that this originated with, then, okay.

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:47

I push back and say, I don't even agree with the use of the word stole because what you're describing fundamentally is the artistic process, right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:55

The artist goes out to the theater, is inspired by the play they see, goes home, right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:01

Writes their own play, creates their own paint.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:03

Like, that has always been the creative process.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:06

We are inspired by each other, and through that we tell our own stories.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:10

And that's kind of the nuance that I feel.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:13

Those of us who use these tools.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:16

I often describe ChatGPT as just the latest word processor that, like the old word processor, which, again, WordPerfect blew my mind, right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:26

It's you who are creating it, is you who are actually making it happen.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:31

And you are influenced by all of the culture and the art that you're consuming.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:37

And again, I feel that that nuance is often lost in the larger debates around how this plays out.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:43

And of course, I will disclose that one of the other greatest Moments in my life was Napster, right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:49

And discovering all the world's music at my fingertips.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:52

And for anyone who experienced that cultural moment, it was transformative.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:58

The other aspect of Generative AI that I would love to kind of get your insights and your reflection on.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:06

And this may be too, not technical or theoretical, but it seems right now the big debate I'm hearing in AI circles is are we about to hit a wall?

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:17

We've been seeing these tools and in your narrative today you keep, oh, right, in the old days of using midjourney and perplexity, because now you might be using something more advanced or now the tool itself has changed.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:30

We've seen such a breakneck pace of development over the last couple of years that there's now rumors that it might be hitting a wall.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:39

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:40

Everyone's saying, where's ChatGPT 5?

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:43

And if it doesn't have a exponential improvement for 4, there's worries about the company's valuation.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:50

So as a user, as someone who is closely watching the industry and the landscape, what's your prediction on where these tools are headed?

Jesse Hirsch 00:29:02

Are they still going to keep blowing our minds in terms of their capability, or are we going to hit a plateau, which is still phenomenal in terms of what it's capable of, but it may not be enough to keep this crazy hype cycle going in terms of the amount of money and resources that are being allocated to it.

Eric 00:29:21

I definitely don't see a plateau in terms of the technology, but I do see adoption going way slower than the technology advances.

Eric 00:29:32

So that's a push pull that'll have to work itself out.

Eric 00:29:35

That's probably, I don't know, that's above my pay grade to figure out how that'll play out.

Eric 00:29:41

But I mean, the investments in the advances aren't going to slow down and all these tools impact one another.

Eric 00:29:50

So I'm always kind of pulling in new tools and new workflows that elevate work in new ways.

Eric 00:30:04

And so I think there'll still be people taking advantage of all the advancements and blowing minds and everyone will be trying to catch up.

Eric 00:30:15

I've heard the same thing about data.

Eric 00:30:16

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

Eric 00:30:18

I think it's going to just keep going really mind blowingly fast.

Jesse Hirsch 00:30:22

Right on.

Jesse Hirsch 00:30:23

Now, in shifting to the creativity part of this, which I think we've been alluding to or touching upon throughout this, because a big thread I want to get into is this accessibility piece, because I think it is a little complicated, but before we go in that direction, what are you excited about in terms of your own projects or your own imagination or your own creative professional desire?

Jesse Hirsch 00:30:50

What are you using these tools for in terms of your own creative ambitions and for lack of a better phrase, your own creative learning curve?

Jesse Hirsch 00:31:00

Because I assume that that's a central part of this.

Eric 00:31:03

Yeah, I mean so far I haven't had to look more than an arm's reach from my own, from where I'm standing for inspiration that I can then use these tools to explore.

Eric 00:31:14

So my first project was based on some ancestry research my dad did that I found and was like, oh cool, let me make a documentary.

Eric 00:31:23

And my most recent project was I made after seeing my kids history textbook about the first artists in a cave in in Indonesia 35, 000 years ago.

Eric 00:31:38

So those are both cases of like, just like, oh, there's inspiration, there's some like.

Eric 00:31:43

And then using these, I haven't really changed the core tools very much at all.

Eric 00:31:49

They've been getting better but it's just like, oh well, it wouldn't take me very long to spin up a quick proof of concept about this or like, you know, and then, then, then agencies started calling and, and like Dream Flare called and that was for original cons.

Eric 00:32:05

So I've had some opportunities to like make these on purpose.

Eric 00:32:08

Like people calling, saying, hey, do you have an idea?

Eric 00:32:12

But it's really like the inspiration is everywhere now.

Eric 00:32:16

Every time I see like a, one of those historical plaques I'm like, oh, you could just blow that up into a video now or anything.

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:23

It's just like, you know, it sounds like what you.

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:26

For the artist, what used to be.

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:28

And again it varies by different artists, but the struggle used to be inspiration.

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:33

Now it seems the struggle is execution.

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:35

And I wouldn't say struggle but I mean that's the focus.

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:39

And then the issue is, well, what are you going to execute?

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:42

Because you have so many options, right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:44

You've, you've so many sources.

Eric 00:32:46

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:48

No, no, please.

Eric 00:32:50

I think, I think it was, the execution was, was a real limiter for most people until now.

Eric 00:32:57

And it's, you know, it's not like it's easy now, but it's at least like you don't have to.

Eric 00:33:02

If you have a laptop, you're pretty much good to go with it.

Eric 00:33:05

Like a few, few bucks in subscriptions.

Eric 00:33:08

You can make a film now which, you know, having gone to film school, I had ideas but I could, the idea that I could get anything made was like, yeah, right.

Eric 00:33:19

And I was in New York, I was pursuing it.

Eric 00:33:22

I was like, I had done it in school, like, and there was still no shot.

Eric 00:33:25

One of my ideas was getting made.

Eric 00:33:27

Like, give me a break now.

Eric 00:33:30

I can make anything.

Eric 00:33:32

The ideas are still flowing, but now I can just.

Eric 00:33:34

I don't have to go, hey, boss, how about this pitch or whatever?

Eric 00:33:37

Like, you know, I just don't do it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:33:40

Let me throw you another curve ball then.

Jesse Hirsch 00:33:42

And this is really me kind of inverting the concept to turn it into a problem to see if you can give me a solution.

Jesse Hirsch 00:33:49

I agree with you that we are at a point of accessibility.

Jesse Hirsch 00:33:52

And in some cases it may not even be a laptop.

Jesse Hirsch 00:33:55

It could be a smartphone.

Jesse Hirsch 00:33:56

Like, I'm seeing kids producing phenomenal media just with the smartphone that the barrier to entry is near zero, the source of inspiration is ubiquitous.

Jesse Hirsch 00:34:11

What then is.

Jesse Hirsch 00:34:12

Because you alluded to the paradox that the adoption may still remain slow.

Jesse Hirsch 00:34:17

So if we are identifying all these ways in which the media world we grew up in is gone and a far more accessible world is here now, then what remains as the barriers of accessibility?

Jesse Hirsch 00:34:30

Because clearly there are some, given the contrast between who is using these tools successfully and who is either turning their nose up to them or just not seeing the opportunity at all.

Jesse Hirsch 00:34:44

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:34:44

They don't have the base media literacy to see what we're seeing in terms of a revolution.

Jesse Hirsch 00:34:50

What would change that?

Jesse Hirsch 00:34:51

And this is me kind of going back to the public broadcaster side of this.

Eric 00:34:56

Yeah.

Eric 00:34:56

So, I mean, it's a really interesting question.

Eric 00:34:59

I mean, it makes me think, like, are the barriers just self imposed at this point?

Eric 00:35:03

You know, do you have an opinion?

Eric 00:35:06

I mean, I'm curious.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:08

I don't.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:08

I mean, my only thought is just the nature of knowledge, that knowledge is itself a kind of virus.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:15

I'm learning lots from you today.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:16

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:17

And in theory, I'm provoking you to think about new things.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:20

So it's a kind of each one teach one scenario where we're communicating in our communities, we're communicating online, but there is still a little bit of an echo chamber effect where the.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:33

Because here, now that I'm saying it, I'll be a little blamey.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:38

The mainstream media still sees AI as a threat.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:42

So rather than use it as a means of teaching people about this new thing the way they did with social media, like every TV show in the world was like, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:53

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:54

And they engaged in a kind of, you know, frontline education.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:57

Like you were doing at the senior's home.

Jesse Hirsch 00:36:01

But there isn't, you know, there aren't really a lot of shows who are teaching people about this.

Jesse Hirsch 00:36:05

You know, the traditional news is talking about this in the business section, but it's not talking about this in the education or the cultural section in an empowering way.

Jesse Hirsch 00:36:15

It's us on the grassroots.

Jesse Hirsch 00:36:17

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:36:17

It's us kind of as practitioners doing it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:36:20

And that's a shame because you and I recognize, oh, my God.

Jesse Hirsch 00:36:24

We're not only at the point where anyone can have a voice, we're at the point where anyone could be an auteur, a director.

Jesse Hirsch 00:36:29

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:36:30

The next Oscar winner.

Jesse Hirsch 00:36:33

And it almost feels like it's a paradox that that isn't, as recognized, more widespread.

Eric 00:36:41

Yeah, I think that's a really.

Eric 00:36:44

I agree with that.

Eric 00:36:45

And I think I have felt a.

Eric 00:36:48

I have felt compelled to help people with it in a way that I have not felt with other technology.

Eric 00:36:54

Like, it hasn't really made me feel like, you know, advances in the past haven't made me feel like I need to, like, help people learn this, to look out for them.

Jesse Hirsch 00:37:04

Yeah.

Eric 00:37:04

Like, it feels like that now.

Eric 00:37:06

Like, whether it's my kids or the seniors or aspiring creatives or my mom, like, people need to learn this.

Eric 00:37:14

They really, really do.

Eric 00:37:15

And it's, you know, it's not hard to teach people.

Eric 00:37:18

I tell people it's the easiest technology they'll ever learn.

Eric 00:37:21

I mean, it's have a conversation level learning.

Eric 00:37:24

You know, there's no.

Eric 00:37:25

You don't have to learn code or anything, but it's really, really important.

Eric 00:37:30

You know, I feel the gap will be wide and widening between the people who learn it and don't and use it and don't.

Eric 00:37:36

And that's gonna be.

Eric 00:37:39

You want to be on the right side of that, you know, help people get on the right side of that.

Jesse Hirsch 00:37:43

And then, you know, let me.

Jesse Hirsch 00:37:45

Let me throw the.

Jesse Hirsch 00:37:45

The fastball right down the plate and get back to the title of this episode, then.

Jesse Hirsch 00:37:50

What is the future of Storytelling?

Jesse Hirsch 00:37:52

Because I think you sort of just answered it in reverse.

Jesse Hirsch 00:37:55

But what do you see?

Jesse Hirsch 00:37:57

A lot of what we've been talking about today is kind of what's happening right now.

Jesse Hirsch 00:38:00

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:38:01

And the tools that are happening right now.

Jesse Hirsch 00:38:03

But what do you see as the future?

Jesse Hirsch 00:38:05

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:38:06

What is the future of storytelling, given that these tools will and should be accessible to as many as possible?

Eric 00:38:13

Well, I think the gap between your imagination and what you can execute is going to just continue to shrink down to nothing.

Eric 00:38:22

It really feels like in the last Year to two years, it's shrunk dramatically and it's just going to continue to happen as the other sort of sensory inputs get better.

Eric 00:38:36

Like you can give ChatGPT video inputs and you can speak to all these things, and then they start to know how to talk to one another and systems get built.

Eric 00:38:47

And like, I mean, you know, I just think, yeah, it's just going to be imagination to output eventually, you know, and interaction and personalization and the processing will be there to do it all in the moment and stuff.

Eric 00:39:07

It's just going to be immersive and incredible, and I want to be a part of that.

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:12

Well, and you kind of reminded me of the moment I first saw an avid nonlinear editing suite, which at the time was revolutionary.

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:22

And I remember seeing, you know, people using it and learning how to use it and think, wow, this is so incredible.

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:27

And then you just kind of evoked the conversational video editing suite, right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:33

Where not only is it nonlinear, but you don't need to learn the Avid keyboard.

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:37

You don't need to learn the way that Avid organized all the buckets.

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:41

You just talk.

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:42

You go, no, let's move that scene over there and let's, let's cut these scenes so that they're cutting between each other really fast.

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:49

I mean, that's phenomenal, right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:50

That is, I think, again, a revolution in media as we've known it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:55

But I have to do diligence to some of my critical listeners in that I think where you and I share the same cognitive bias is that we're excited about this stuff.

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:08

I speak for myself.

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:09

I'm intoxicated by these tools because they are allowing, as you said, the gap between my imagination and the actual stories I want to tell to be almost instant.

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:21

Is there aspects of this that you're concerned about that you're fearful of?

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:25

And maybe the parallel here was my question about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in that there is concerns that the limited resources we have for community media might go.

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:37

Is there a parallel here in the AI space?

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:40

Is there something, some idiotic policy or some stupid technology fetish that you think could ruin the party and could kind of take this optimistic vision that you and I share and threaten it?

Eric 00:40:57

I mean, it seems like the stakes are very high.

Eric 00:41:00

It seems like the worst fears are legitimate, worst fears in most cases.

Eric 00:41:08

And I want to believe that we have the systems and the values to build in a way that will keep us all safe and financially stable.

Eric 00:41:21

But that remains to be seen.

Eric 00:41:23

And, you know, our country's been.

Jesse Hirsch 00:41:27

You.

Eric 00:41:28

Know, struggling to get aligned on much of anything.

Eric 00:41:31

So it's concerning and I could go on and on about, about those concerns, but I think I'm, you know, if I had to narrow it down, I'd probably just, just bring it down to the people that will be losing jobs in large numbers in lots of fields at the same time in the probably near future.

Eric 00:41:53

And like, that's really concerning to think that there's going to be this mass of unemployed job people.

Eric 00:42:02

I don't know that the opportunities will come fast enough.

Jesse Hirsch 00:42:09

That's one of the narratives, actually, we've explored here on the show before, and I'm still skeptical.

Jesse Hirsch 00:42:14

I'm not convinced that that mass unemployment is going to happen.

Jesse Hirsch 00:42:17

I acknowledge its potential, but I also think that education under the right circumstances could mitigate that substantively.

Jesse Hirsch 00:42:26

Now, granted, don't get me talking about the current state of our education system.

Jesse Hirsch 00:42:30

That might be its own problem, but I think the through line of our conversation today has been the participatory nature of these tools.

Jesse Hirsch 00:42:39

You got to use them to understand them.

Jesse Hirsch 00:42:42

They allow people to express themselves.

Jesse Hirsch 00:42:44

And I think the more people who are using these tools, the more we as the users will be empowered to ensure that this future of creativity, of storytelling is accessible.

Jesse Hirsch 00:42:57

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:42:58

That it is small d democratic and it is kind of part of a renaissance, as it were.

Jesse Hirsch 00:43:05

One final question before I go to our Shout out section because you just kind of inspired it when you were talking about the contemporary politics.

Jesse Hirsch 00:43:12

What do you think about this TikTok ban and the kind of politics and drama around TikTok?

Jesse Hirsch 00:43:19

Because TikTok has become a juggernaut of the cultural industry and touching almost all sides of it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:43:26

And if it does shut down next week, which I kind of anticipate, it's going to create a huge vacuum in the American media landscape.

Jesse Hirsch 00:43:36

So any comments, thoughts, insights on this kind of media maelstrom that's currently underway?

Eric 00:43:44

Yeah, I mean, it's a little above my pay grade and, you know, I.

Eric 00:43:52

I've been watching it, but also sort of feeling like I agree with you that it looks like, you know, very, very likely.

Eric 00:44:01

And so I think the most interesting thing will be the exodus of the users to where.

Eric 00:44:05

Where are they going?

Eric 00:44:07

That will be really interesting.

Eric 00:44:09

I think the options are challenging.

Eric 00:44:13

Most people have opted out of the other places already.

Eric 00:44:16

Yeah, in a lot of cases.

Eric 00:44:17

So that will be very interesting.

Eric 00:44:19

I'm not sure.

Eric 00:44:20

I wish I had something more insightful for you, but.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:22

Well, to your point, it's ripe for a newcomer and who that newcomer is if I was Satya Nadella, I would be looking at OpenAI and saying, Guys, what can we do here?

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:34

Can we create a kind of social media platform from scratch as quick as possible and just be, hey, we're not meta and hope that that's enough?

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:44

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:45

And I suspect there are some smarter people than us who have more wealth than us who are having that conversation and thinking.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:54

But it's at this point in every episode of Meta Views that we do our Shout out section.

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:03

The purpose of our Shout out section is to ask our guest if there's anyone that they want to say, I'm thinking about you.

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:12

But specifically it's about bringing folks to our audience's attention.

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:17

Right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:19

Someone that you think they should know about more, someone that you've been reading.

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:23

It doesn't have to be a living person.

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:24

It could be a dead person.

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:26

Heck, it could be an AI.

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:28

I'll go first.

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:29

I want to give a shout out to WMYC's show on the Media, which I listen to as a podcast.

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:37

And it's kind of NPR's media industry show that really looks at the media in general, from AI to social media.

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:47

But of course, as part of the NPR kind of ecosystem, they've got a real angle in terms of that public broadcasting stuff.

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:54

So I recommend to you and our listeners the on the Media podcast, I think comes out twice a week.

Jesse Hirsch 00:46:00

And it keeps me informed about the media industry, in particular the public broadcasting element within the United States.

Jesse Hirsch 00:46:09

But, Eric, I'm curious if there's anyone, any organization, any bot, that you want to give a shout out to.

Eric 00:46:16

I think maybe I'll, in the name of sort of raising awareness about for your listeners, the Midjourney magazine, the actual printed magazine, is something that I'm really enjoying lately.

Eric 00:46:29

And it just arrived, so that's why I think a lot of people don't know that it exists.

Eric 00:46:33

And there's something about pairing all this AI image generation with the, you know, real Deal magazine.

Eric 00:46:42

I find it just a nice thing to go through and.

Eric 00:46:44

And you can read the prompts that generated the images.

Eric 00:46:47

And this is, you know, tens of thousands of images curated down to I don't know how many are in a magazine, but that's pretty cool to see the different styles and the reasons that they pick these things.

Eric 00:46:59

And it's like four bucks a quarter or something like that.

Eric 00:47:03

So it's kind of a collector's item in my mind at this period of time, the beginning of AI and all this.

Eric 00:47:09

I kind of think it's a Cool thing.

Jesse Hirsch 00:47:11

Yeah, far out.

Jesse Hirsch 00:47:12

I didn't know about it and I've been on and off an active paying mid journey user.

Jesse Hirsch 00:47:16

So thanks for the heads up.

Jesse Hirsch 00:47:18

It kind of reminds me of the early dot com era where you know, Mondo 2000 and Wired magazine, those early issues now are huge collector items for the same reason.

Jesse Hirsch 00:47:29

So yeah, that's a great hot tip.

Jesse Hirsch 00:47:31

Thank you very much.

Jesse Hirsch 00:47:33

And you know, before we conclude, is there any where can our listeners learn more about you and the stuff you're doing and or connect with you on social media?

Eric 00:47:44

Yeah, thank you.

Eric 00:47:44

I spend a lot of time on LinkedIn.

Eric 00:47:46

You can find me at Eric Archer there and that's Eric spelled and I have a portfolio site@cgacreative.com and if you care to check out our public media work, that's at 1623studios.org.

Jesse Hirsch 00:48:01

Right on, right on.

Jesse Hirsch 00:48:02

Well, thank you Eric.

Jesse Hirsch 00:48:04

This has been a really thoroughly enjoyable conversation.

Jesse Hirsch 00:48:11

Yeah, I appreciate the time.

Jesse Hirsch 00:48:12

I mean you're more than welcome to come back on the show, you know, six months a year from now to talk about your projects and to talk about the stuff going because of the people I've been having on and the people I've been meeting.

Jesse Hirsch 00:48:25

You are by far, I think the most effective public educator when it comes to AI because you're really grounding it in a substance and I think a virtue, which is the creativity part.

Jesse Hirsch 00:48:39

So thank you very much, I think has been a great episode to all our listeners.

Jesse Hirsch 00:48:45

Thanks again for watching, for listening.

Jesse Hirsch 00:48:48

You can reach us on the usual socials, let us know what subjects or guests that you would like us to feature and of course we'll see everybody soon.

Jesse Hirsch 00:48:59

Thanks again.
