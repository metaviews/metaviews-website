In this episode of *Metaviews*, host Jesse Hirsh welcomes back Laura Brekelmans—our resident Goddess of Chaos, Complexity, and Contradiction—for a conversation that refuses to resolve neatly. Building on her previous appearance exploring the thought-worlds of Wittgenstein and McLuhan, this dialogue ventures deeper into the entangled relationships between language, meaning, technology, and the sacred.

Together, Jesse and Laura explore the provocative question: what would a new religion for the digital age look like? One that doesn’t position nature and technology in opposition, but instead seeks to harmonize them. Along the way, they interrogate the limits of rationality, the necessity of myth, and the power of contradiction as a creative force.

This episode is not about tidy answers—it’s about embracing the generative mess of complexity, the poetry of systems thinking, and the spiritual imperative to live in tension with our time.
