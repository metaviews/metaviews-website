Jim Marshall introduces the revolutionary concept of Septemics, a philosophical science that categorizes human phenomena into a hierarchy of seven levels. With a background as a polymathic intellectual, Jim shares insights from his extensive studies spanning psychology, philosophy, and various other disciplines, emphasizing the importance of synthesis in understanding complex human experiences. He explores how education can be transformed to cultivate lifelong learning and improve literacy, arguing that a deeper grasp of language is essential for effective communication. Throughout the discussion, Jim provides relatable examples, illustrating how Septemics can help individuals navigate personal challenges and enhance their relationships. The conversation highlights the potential for Septemics to address societal discordance, offering accessible tools for anyone seeking to improve their lives and understanding of the world around them.

The latest episode of Metaviews features an enlightening conversation between host Jesse Hirsh and guest Jim Marshall, a polymathic intellectual renowned for his development of Septemics, a groundbreaking framework for understanding human behavior. The episode opens with a timely discussion about the potential ramifications of the Supreme Court's rulings on social media platforms like TikTok, setting the stage for deeper insights into the nature of knowledge and its application in our lives. Hirsch and Marshall explore how the specialized nature of contemporary society often leads to echo chambers and a lack of holistic understanding, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches to learning.

Marshall shares his personal journey of over 50,000 hours dedicated to studying various aspects of human potential, underscoring the importance of lifelong learning and the cultivation of curiosity. His experiences reveal a profound understanding of how language and literacy impact our ability to connect, comprehend, and communicate effectively. He argues for a reevaluation of the educational system to prioritize vocabulary and language skills as fundamental tools for personal and societal development, which aligns with the core tenets of Septemics. By articulating human experiences through a seven-level hierarchy, Septemics serves as a practical tool for individuals seeking clarity in their relationships and personal dilemmas.

Throughout the episode, Marshall provides relatable examples, illustrating how Septemics can facilitate deeper self-awareness and problem-solving. The discussion culminates in an exploration of how this framework can address the discordance experienced in modern society, offering a pathway towards unity and understanding. As Marshall articulates, Septemics is not merely an academic exercise but a practical philosophy that can empower individuals to navigate their lives with greater purpose and insight. This episode serves as a compelling reminder of the potential for transformative knowledge to shape our understanding of ourselves and each other.

Hi, I'm Jesse Hirsch and welcome to Metaviews, recorded live in front of an automated audience.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:12

Today I'm really quite privileged and honored to be joined by Jim Marshall, who strikes me as an incredibly smart individual who has a really interesting concept to share.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:27

And of course, before we do that, we always like to structure our program with a few segments to get things off for our listeners.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:36

And you know, today in news, of course, the big news going around right now is this could be the end days of TikTok.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:43

The Supreme Court is currently having a hearing, although incoming President Donald Trump does say that he can make a deal.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:52

So you never know how that's going to swing or how that's going to play.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:56

That's the big news right now on the Meta Views newsletter.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:01

Now, Jim, I always ask people at this point if they have any news that they would like to share.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:06

Could be personal news, could be world news, could be local news.

Jim Marshall 00:01:11

Well, I should let you know that the Supreme Court has already upheld the ban on TikTok, so thank you.

Jim Marshall 00:01:19

So TikTok is going to be changing hands.

Jim Marshall 00:01:23

So there's a lot of discussion now about who's going to buy it, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

Jim Marshall 00:01:35

Very rich businessman, he's talking about buying it and he says if he buys it it'll be, you know, what everybody wants it to be.

Jim Marshall 00:01:43

And I believe him because I've been listening to this guy for a long time.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:47

Right on.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:48

And this is exactly why I have a news segment, right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:52

Because it's great to start off and in this case have the guest bring breaking news of what's happening right now.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:59

And to your point, it'll be interesting to see what deal unfolds.

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:03

Cuz Kevin O'Leary's not the only person who's gathered a consortium.

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:08

So I think this is high stakes and it'll make the next few days, I think really interesting.

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:12

Now our second segment on every show we call WTF or what's the Future?

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:20

And this is where we like to ask our guest, you know, Jim, is there anything about the future that you're excited about?

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:26

And this could be near term future, long term future.

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:28

But what are you looking forward to?

Jim Marshall 00:02:30

I'm excited about going to heaven and becoming an angel.

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:36

Right on.

Jim Marshall 00:02:36

Which for me is the next big thing.

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:39

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:40

That is a fantastic way to be thinking about the future.

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:44

And I think a really good way to start our discussion because.

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:47

Because what I do with every guest is I kind of try to take three themes that allow us to Weave a conversation to really get the most of the guest's insights and intelligence, but also allow our readers to connect not just to your subject material, but think about how it applies to the world around us.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:07

And that's where I wanted to start with the concept of synthesis.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:10

Because when I was researching you and kind of looking up your story, I was immediately impressed and blown away at the breadth, the width of your knowledge that, you know, we live in a society, unfortunately, that involves a lot of specialists, right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:27

People really do deep dives into particular areas, particular specialties, and there aren't enough people who connect the dots, right, who are able to really transcend disciplines, go into different subject areas.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:43

So this is really a two part question which you can answer as you wish.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:48

How did you do that?

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:49

How did you decide, or accidentally even, how did you end up coming across such a diverse range of areas of expertise and disciplines?

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:59

And how does that relate to this theme I'm introducing today of synthesis?

Jesse Hirsch 00:04:04

I'm trying to synthesize ideas, synthesize concepts, and as I'm saying, connect the dots.

Jim Marshall 00:04:10

Okay, first of all, I was a born polymath.

Jim Marshall 00:04:14

I have no memory whatsoever of a time when I was not intensely interested in learning everything that taught in every university.

Jim Marshall 00:04:23

Now, of course, that's impossible, but the point is, the drive was there.

Jim Marshall 00:04:28

I wanted to learn.

Jim Marshall 00:04:29

I wanted to know.

Jim Marshall 00:04:31

I can still remember the exact moment when I discovered, to my surprise, that some children didn't like school.

Jim Marshall 00:04:40

I couldn't believe that I loved school.

Jim Marshall 00:04:44

I was thrilled to take my briefcase and go to school and learn long division or whatever it was they were teaching that day.

Jim Marshall 00:04:52

And so I went to school for 28 years and frankly, I would have gone longer.

Jim Marshall 00:04:58

But you don't live forever, you know, when you have other things to do, life happens.

Jim Marshall 00:05:05

So if I knew I was going to live another 30 or 40 years, I'd probably go back to school.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:12

Well, let me ask you.

Jim Marshall 00:05:13

It doesn't matter what subject.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:15

Let me ask you a quick follow up there because we're in a moment where education, I think, has an opportunity to really transform.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:24

And part of this, of course, is the rise of AI, the role of the Internet, mobile, smartphones and classes, how.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:32

I'm a big fan of lifelong learning, as you clearly are.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:35

How do we make education more accessible and exciting so that people don't think it's something they finish when they're young, but it's something that they just find joy in constantly?

Jim Marshall 00:05:49

Okay, there are a couple of answers to that, both of which are germane.

Jim Marshall 00:05:53

First of all, the biggest problem is that language is not well taught.

Jim Marshall 00:06:02

Most people do not know the language well enough.

Jim Marshall 00:06:07

Now, when I say most people, this includes people with graduate degrees.

Jim Marshall 00:06:11

I have known many people with graduate degrees.

Jesse Hirsch 00:06:14

Well, if I could just jump in quickly.

Jesse Hirsch 00:06:18

If I could jump in quickly.

Jesse Hirsch 00:06:20

I think this is a consequence of the specialization that they learn jargon but not actually language.

Jesse Hirsch 00:06:26

Please continue.

Jim Marshall 00:06:27

Yeah, so I think the school system to begin with should add another hour, not take anything away, just add another hour to every day of school, all the way from kindergarten up to graduating high school, of just vocabulary.

Jim Marshall 00:06:47

Because as some.

Jim Marshall 00:06:50

Somebody who is very literate.

Jim Marshall 00:06:53

I live in a world of what I consider to be illiterate people.

Jim Marshall 00:06:57

Now, when I, when I say live in a world talking about, I cannot, you know, I spend a lot of time on the Internet one way or another, I cannot find anybody who knows language as well as I know it and as well as the people who I learned from.

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:15

Well, and.

Jim Marshall 00:07:16

And that includes professional speakers.

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:18

And to your point, I'm a student of the great Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan, and he talked a lot about how language is shaped by media and his greatest fear, and this was one of the reasons why he went, he was Catholic and he went to mass every morning because he feared that electronic media was killing the printed word, that it was killing literacy, because people were no longer becoming literate.

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:46

They were still oral in the sense that they could speak.

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:49

And social media, it's a very oral medium.

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:52

Right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:52

It's people talking even if they're typing what they're saying.

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:56

And you're quite right to note that there's a kind of loss of literacy.

Jesse Hirsch 00:07:59

So let's kind of segue this in into your concept of septemics.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:04

If I'm pronouncing it correctly.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:05

You are.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:07

Why don't you give us the kind of high level explainer, walk us into this.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:12

Because what blew me away about this was again, similar to your own intellectual background, it's transdisciplinary.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:20

You're connecting a lot of the dots.

Jim Marshall 00:08:22

That's right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:08:23

So give us that meta view, give us that big picture of septemics.

Jim Marshall 00:08:27

Okay, so the first thing I should say is that I am the discoverer of hitherto unknown natural phenomena which greatly aid in the understanding of people, from which I created a revolutionary practical philosophic system called septemics and published it in the book Hierarchies of Human Phenomena.

Jim Marshall 00:08:52

Sepemics is a philosophical science based on the fact that many phenomena related to human beings occur in A sequence of seven levels.

Jim Marshall 00:09:02

Literally, the word septemics means of or pertaining to seven Septemics comprises a collection of scales or sequences, each of which breaks down various human phenomena into a hierarchy of seven steps.

Jim Marshall 00:09:17

There are 35 such scales, each of which is unique, and together they span the spectrum of human experience, by which I mean any problem, dilemma, situation, difficulty, etc.

Jim Marshall 00:09:32

That any person has can successfully be analyzed by one or more of these skills, usually more than one.

Jesse Hirsch 00:09:41

So can you give an example, hypothetical, in the sense of a person that's not necessarily real?

Jesse Hirsch 00:09:48

We don't want to violate anyone's privacy, but can you sort of, whether an archetype or perhaps someone from your past, without naming them?

Jesse Hirsch 00:09:58

So let's apply this as a kind of example.

Jim Marshall 00:10:01

Okay, so let's say you have a friend, your friend Fred.

Jim Marshall 00:10:06

Every time you see Fred, he says, jesse, I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do.

Jim Marshall 00:10:10

My wife, she's driving me nuts.

Jim Marshall 00:10:12

She's doing this and that and that.

Jim Marshall 00:10:15

And I think she's fooling around with some guy.

Jim Marshall 00:10:18

We're not getting along, right?

Jim Marshall 00:10:20

So you get tired of listening to this after six months, and you say, fred, come here, let me show you something.

Jim Marshall 00:10:26

And you open the septemics book to the scale of relationships, and you put it in front of his face.

Jim Marshall 00:10:34

Now, because this is natural law, he will get it if he can read English.

Jim Marshall 00:10:41

So he looks at it and he'll say, huh?

Jim Marshall 00:10:44

You mean there's a scale of relationships?

Jim Marshall 00:10:47

And you say, yes, this relationship that you've been complaining to me about for six months, where is it on this scale?

Jim Marshall 00:10:54

I guarantee you he's going to want to know that because he's having trouble with this.

Jim Marshall 00:11:00

So he looks at the scale, and in a matter of seconds he will find a bracket.

Jim Marshall 00:11:05

He will say something like, well, I can see right off we're not at level one, two, or three because that's the top of the scale and we're having all kinds of trouble.

Jim Marshall 00:11:15

You say, okay, you got it down to four, so why don't you just read the text and then you can get it exactly.

Jim Marshall 00:11:22

Guaranteed he's going to want to do that because you're opening a door for him.

Jim Marshall 00:11:26

So he reads the text and he comes back.

Jim Marshall 00:11:29

He knows the relationship now, he knows the scale.

Jim Marshall 00:11:32

And he says, well, now that I read this, I can see we're at level five, the one we're having a lot of trouble.

Jim Marshall 00:11:38

That's near the bottom of the scale.

Jim Marshall 00:11:40

And he will have a realization.

Jim Marshall 00:11:43

He'll Say that explains why.

Jim Marshall 00:11:45

Bop at a bop at a bop at a bop at a bop.

Jesse Hirsch 00:11:47

So let me ask a question based on a phrase you used a little earlier, which was, if I recall it correctly, a kind of science philosophy.

Jim Marshall 00:11:57

Philosophical science.

Jesse Hirsch 00:11:58

A philosophical science.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:00

And let's tie that to what we sort of agreed on in the context that we're dealing with pervasive illiteracy.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:08

And one of the consequences of pervasive illiteracy is people have lost access to philosophy, right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:14

They're not reading the classics, they're not reading contemporary philosophy, they're not being exposed to that level of ideas.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:20

So if I understand you correctly, you're sort of providing a framework by which people can access kind of the philosophical needs that they would require to get through life.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:32

But they don't have, let's say, the knowledge that you have, they don't have the literacy that you have.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:37

So this allows them to kind of, I don't want to use the word shortcut, but achieve the same thing a philosopher would through time, but they're using it through, through this framework.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:50

Is that a correct analogy?

Jim Marshall 00:12:52

I don't think the average user is going to get a philosophical impact from this.

Jim Marshall 00:12:59

Now, somebody who is very learned, like for example, if Jordan Peterson were to read this book, he would see the philosophical depth in it because he's a very well educated person with several college degrees.

Jim Marshall 00:13:11

But the average person, that's not how they're going to experience it.

Jim Marshall 00:13:14

Like this friend Fred, what's going to happen is he understands his relationship better.

Jim Marshall 00:13:20

He's thinking about Mary, see?

Jim Marshall 00:13:23

And then you say to him, well, that's great that you found you at level five.

Jim Marshall 00:13:27

You know, you can move this relationship up to level four.

Jim Marshall 00:13:30

He says, you can.

Jim Marshall 00:13:31

You say, yeah.

Jim Marshall 00:13:32

It tells him in the book how to do that.

Jim Marshall 00:13:33

Oh.

Jim Marshall 00:13:35

Then you say, well, wait a minute, Fred, let me show you something else.

Jim Marshall 00:13:38

And you show him the scale of sexuality.

Jim Marshall 00:13:40

He's going to look at it, he's gonna get it.

Jim Marshall 00:13:43

He's gonna say, because it's natural law.

Jim Marshall 00:13:46

So he said, oh, this makes sense.

Jim Marshall 00:13:49

There's a scale of sexuality.

Jim Marshall 00:13:51

I never heard of this.

Jim Marshall 00:13:52

And you're gonna say, yeah, you don't have to tell me if you don't want.

Jim Marshall 00:13:56

But for your own illumination, where are you on this scale?

Jim Marshall 00:14:00

Guaranteed, he's gonna want to know that because he's having trouble.

Jim Marshall 00:14:04

So he looks at it and he'll throw out some of it.

Jim Marshall 00:14:06

He'll say, well, I can see right away, 6 and 7 have nothing to do with me.

Jim Marshall 00:14:12

So it's got to be one through five and say, okay, go ahead and read it.

Jim Marshall 00:14:15

You can get it.

Jim Marshall 00:14:16

Well, he knows who he is, right.

Jim Marshall 00:14:19

And so he reads it because, well, now that I've read it, I can see him at level four.

Jim Marshall 00:14:23

This is not hard to get, see, because it's natural law, and he has a realization as a result of it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:31

So to bring it back then, to this concept of the future, where would Fred be as a result of septemics?

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:39

Like, if you think about it, from, you know, the hero's journey.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:42

Right, right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:44

Where does Fred end up as a result?

Jim Marshall 00:14:46

Okay, so first of all, I could keep doing what I've been doing for the last three minutes and say, show you how this would.

Jim Marshall 00:14:55

He could look at the scale of allegiance.

Jim Marshall 00:14:57

He could look at the scale of motivation.

Jim Marshall 00:14:59

Right.

Jim Marshall 00:14:59

For when you have a romantic relationship, it's complicated.

Jim Marshall 00:15:03

Right.

Jim Marshall 00:15:04

So you could easily have 20, 25 different scales that apply.

Jim Marshall 00:15:09

And in each one, he's going to look at, he's going to say, oh, that's where I am.

Jim Marshall 00:15:14

And he has a realization now.

Jim Marshall 00:15:16

Every time he has a realization, he is unraveling this knot in his mind.

Jim Marshall 00:15:21

See, it's getting clearer and clearer now.

Jim Marshall 00:15:24

What he does with that is up to him.

Jim Marshall 00:15:26

He might say, you know what, Jesse, I'm going to get this book and I'm going to show it to Mary and I'm going to straighten out our relationship right now.

Jim Marshall 00:15:34

Mary might say, oh, very interesting.

Jim Marshall 00:15:37

Let me see this.

Jim Marshall 00:15:37

Or she might say, take a hike.

Jim Marshall 00:15:39

I'm not reading any books.

Jim Marshall 00:15:40

We don't know.

Jim Marshall 00:15:41

Right.

Jim Marshall 00:15:42

So then the other thing is he also could say, you know what?

Jim Marshall 00:15:47

Now that I see all this, I realize I'm wasting my time in this relationship.

Jesse Hirsch 00:15:51

Right.

Jim Marshall 00:15:52

This is a train wreck.

Jesse Hirsch 00:15:53

Because that, that's, that's what I was going to ask.

Jesse Hirsch 00:15:56

And again, I'm kind of bringing it back to the philosophical, because that appeals to our audience is part of the goal.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:03

And in particular, the use of the word hierarchy and levels is part of the goal.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:07

Transcendence in the sense that he's trying to elevate himself to a higher point of happiness, a more functional way of living.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:17

Better relationships, better work.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:19

Is that in essence the goal here?

Jim Marshall 00:16:22

Certainly the second part of what you said there.

Jim Marshall 00:16:26

In other words, this facilitates the solving of problems regarding human beings, because that's.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:35

Where I wanted to bring us to this third theme of discordance.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:39

And discordance in the sense of a disconnection of meaning, a disconnection of understanding, as well as a Disconnection of shared meaning and understanding.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:51

Because it feels that to me, that is the consequence of an over specialized society is you have a lot of people in echo chambers and silos.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:01

Does septemics allow for that response to discordance?

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:06

Does it allow for, you know, you gave the example of within a relationship, sort of, you know, addressing the potential discordance or dysfunction in a relationship.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:17

Am I correct in thinking that septemics could be a tool to address this discordance that we're dealing with?

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:24

And I don't know if you agree with me that there's a discordance, but I'm really trying to juxtapose this synthesis and discordance in terms of what I think has resulted in your brilliance, has been your ability to synthesize all these different ideas and now present it in a way that is very accessible.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:43

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:43

And is very useful to people.

Jim Marshall 00:17:45

Yes.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:47

I'm curious then to hear whether you think septemics is a response to discordance or a potential counter to discordance as.

Jim Marshall 00:17:57

It'S a solution to discordance.

Jim Marshall 00:18:00

Please elaborate because this is user friendly.

Jim Marshall 00:18:06

I went through a lot of trouble to make this easy for people to understand, assuming they can read English.

Jim Marshall 00:18:14

And I know I succeeded at that because some version of this book has existed now for 29 years and I've been watching people use this.

Jim Marshall 00:18:23

Okay?

Jim Marshall 00:18:24

So if a person read English reasonably well, and most people in industrialized society now can, even if they're not, even if it's not their first language, they can use this to fix their lives.

Jesse Hirsch 00:18:39

Although technical question.

Jim Marshall 00:18:42

Yes.

Jesse Hirsch 00:18:42

Do you think, and only you could answer this.

Jesse Hirsch 00:18:45

Do you think that the insights, the wisdom, the tools in the book would be lost in translation?

Jesse Hirsch 00:18:53

And I say this obviously because we're living in a world now where people are using Google Translate, they're using translation tools, they may be translating your book without your knowledge.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:05

Would you be worried that some of that might be lost?

Jim Marshall 00:19:08

Yes, because I'm an extremely literate person.

Jim Marshall 00:19:15

Okay.

Jim Marshall 00:19:16

I was writing poetry in Latin for recreation when I was 17, so I know the English language about as well as William F.

Jim Marshall 00:19:26

Buckley.

Jim Marshall 00:19:28

So I absolutely cringe.

Jim Marshall 00:19:33

Okay, quick thought that anybody's going to run this through Google Translate and try to make sense of it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:38

Hot pursuit then.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:40

And this goes into the audience at home.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:43

Jim and I were having a really fascinating conversation before we pressed record to the point that I wished I'd pressed record.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:49

So I have to ask you the totally meta views, random question.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:53

What do you think William F.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:55

Buckley would say?

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:56

About Mr.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:57

Trump, because they're two distinct personalities.

Jim Marshall 00:20:03

Well, I think at.

Jim Marshall 00:20:05

I think he would say very much what the people at his magazine have been saying, which is that when he first came on the scene, they opposed him, but he won them over.

Jim Marshall 00:20:18

And so now they don't oppose him so much in general.

Jim Marshall 00:20:21

That is what has happened.

Jim Marshall 00:20:23

I mean, he just won the highest number of votes ever for a Republican.

Jim Marshall 00:20:30

I mean, he won the popular vote, which hasn't happened in 20 years, for a Republican.

Jim Marshall 00:20:36

So he has been winning people over.

Jim Marshall 00:20:38

Now, I'll tell you, when he first ran, I did not vote for him in the primary, but he won me over, and I think he would have won.

Jim Marshall 00:20:48

If you listen to the people from national radio, which I do, he's winning people over.

Jim Marshall 00:20:54

He's winning all kinds of people over.

Jim Marshall 00:20:56

He's doing very much what Ronald Reagan did.

Jim Marshall 00:20:59

You know, Ronald Reagan in 1984 won 49 states, a massive landslide that will never happen again.

Jim Marshall 00:21:08

Okay?

Jim Marshall 00:21:09

So he obviously was connected to not only Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Libertarians, all people who never voted before.

Jim Marshall 00:21:18

Okay, It's a win, 49 states.

Jim Marshall 00:21:21

So this is similar to what's been happening where people were skeptical of Reagan and he won them over.

Jim Marshall 00:21:28

And that's what's happening with Trump.

Jim Marshall 00:21:29

Lots of people, Democrats, are saying, yeah, okay, I get it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:21:34

You know, one of the reasons why I podcast is I like to talk to smart people like yourself.

Jesse Hirsch 00:21:42

I also loved school.

Jesse Hirsch 00:21:43

I love learning.

Jesse Hirsch 00:21:44

I love talking to knowledgeable people.

Jesse Hirsch 00:21:47

So, you know, let me try to throw you a curveball as we start to wrap this up.

Jesse Hirsch 00:21:52

If President Trump were to invite you to Mar a Lago or to invite you to the White House and say, jim, how can septemics heal the nation?

Jesse Hirsch 00:22:03

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:22:03

How can we use septemics to deal with the division in America, the anxiety in America?

Jesse Hirsch 00:22:13

A, would you be up for that call?

Jesse Hirsch 00:22:15

And B, how would you respond to such an opportunity?

Jim Marshall 00:22:19

I would be up for the call.

Jim Marshall 00:22:20

I would say to him, this is natural law.

Jim Marshall 00:22:26

These scales exist the same way that the Pythagorean theorem exists, the same way that the three laws of motion exist, the same way the periodic table exists.

Jim Marshall 00:22:35

They're inarguable.

Jim Marshall 00:22:37

And if you study them, you'll see that you'll get it.

Jim Marshall 00:22:40

It's not hard to understand this because it's natural law.

Jim Marshall 00:22:43

And because it's natural law, people get it.

Jim Marshall 00:22:46

People across the spectrum get it.

Jim Marshall 00:22:49

Now, there are people who.

Jim Marshall 00:22:50

Who are not going to get it because they're inaccessible.

Jim Marshall 00:22:55

Psychopaths, sociopaths, maniacs, lunatics, professional criminals, war criminals, serial murderers, you know, they're not, they're not part of this.

Jim Marshall 00:23:06

But he would get it and certain people would get it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:12

Well, and in the language of deal making, what would be the return?

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:17

What would be the payoff?

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:18

And I don't mean personally, because I thought you made a great case with Fred.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:22

Our kind of fictitious example, really the example.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:25

And here at Metaviews, we often get into this a lot.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:28

We like to look at the big picture, the society level.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:33

Give me the payout.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:34

In terms of how this could heal.

Jim Marshall 00:23:35

America, if this book were to proliferate, it would have a greater impact than the Bible or the Koran or the Tao Te Ching, because it's natural law.

Jim Marshall 00:23:48

It's just like how much of an impact did Newton's three laws of motion have?

Jim Marshall 00:23:53

Right.

Jim Marshall 00:23:53

It's earth shaking.

Jim Marshall 00:23:55

It went right into calculus.

Jim Marshall 00:23:59

Okay.

Jim Marshall 00:23:59

Which is a very useful, continuously applied thing in science and engineering.

Jim Marshall 00:24:07

So this is real.

Jim Marshall 00:24:10

It's accessible to anyone who can read English and wants to help himself or others.

Jim Marshall 00:24:17

And so.

Jesse Hirsch 00:24:39

Well, Mr.

Jesse Hirsch 00:24:40

Trump, if you're listening, please reach out to Jim Marshall.

Jesse Hirsch 00:24:45

I think he'd very much be up for the task.

Jesse Hirsch 00:24:48

Now, Jim, we like to end each show with shout outs.

Jesse Hirsch 00:24:52

And these could be shout outs to real people, dead people, fictional people.

Jesse Hirsch 00:24:58

I'm gonna go first.

Jesse Hirsch 00:24:59

I want to give a shout out to Marshall McLuhan only because he came up in today's conversation and he was a thinker.

Jesse Hirsch 00:25:05

I enjoyed a lot.

Jesse Hirsch 00:25:06

And I want to give a shout out to my friend Rick Salutin, who right before this show I was just emailing about coming to his class at the University of Toronto and talking to you.

Jesse Hirsch 00:25:17

Jim really reminded me about, you know, even now when I'm not a student, I love to show up at universities and get free education, sit in in classes and talk to the professors.

Jesse Hirsch 00:25:29

So, Jim, before we go, do you have any shout outs?

Jesse Hirsch 00:25:32

Anyone you want to let know that you're thinking about them?

Jim Marshall 00:25:38

I have a message for the people of Earth who are decent, sensible people.

Jim Marshall 00:25:47

And here's my message.

Jim Marshall 00:25:49

The data in this book is vital for every person and can help you to achieve your goals faster and easier by explaining what might otherwise seem to be inexplicable or random.

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:06

Right on.

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:07

Thank you very much.

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:08

Jim Marshall.

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:10

Septemics.com if anyone, I assume if they go to the site, your contact info or they can contact you through there.

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:18

Is there any social media that you would like to promote?

Jim Marshall 00:26:22

Not particular.

Jim Marshall 00:26:23

I mean the website is really the best place to go.

Jim Marshall 00:26:25

Because it's, it's crafted in a specific way to explain what this is to somebody who doesn't know anything about it.

Jim Marshall 00:26:33

And I've been told many times it's a good site.

Jim Marshall 00:26:35

People get it.

Jim Marshall 00:26:36

You can hear what readers have said about it, what journalists have written about it, what the reviews are.

Jim Marshall 00:26:41

You can read sections of the book itself.

Jim Marshall 00:26:43

And there's even a 15 minute introduction to septemic recording that you can listen to.

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:50

Right on.

Jim Marshall 00:26:51

So it's very easy to go there and get what this is about.

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:56

Right on.

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:57

Thank you very much, as always.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:00

This is Jesse Hirsch for Meta Views.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:02

We put out our episodes as often as we can.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:06

We love talking to people like Jim.

Jesse Hirsch 00:27:08
