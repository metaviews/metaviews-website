In this episode of Metaviews, Jesse Hirsh is joined by technologist and thinker Russell McOrmand for a wide-ranging conversation that dismantles the myth of "human nature" and exposes the lingering shadows of eugenics in modern institutions. Together, they explore how corporate culture has infested political discourse, reducing democracy to a sport and sidelining long-term thinking in favor of short-term spectacle.

What would it mean to think seven generations ahead? What role could neurodivergent individuals play in building better futures? And how might we imagine a news service designed by and for neurodivergent people—one that prioritizes clarity, complexity, and care over clickbait?

From systemic critique to visionary alternatives, this episode offers a radical reframing of where we are—and where we could go.
