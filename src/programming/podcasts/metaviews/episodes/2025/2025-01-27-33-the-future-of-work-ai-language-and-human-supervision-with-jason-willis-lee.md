The dialogue between Jesse Hirsh and Jason Willis-Lee offers a profound exploration of the future of work, particularly through the lens of language services in the age of AI. Jason, a medical translator with a background in broadcasting, emphasizes the importance of human-in-the-loop systems, arguing that AI should enhance, not replace, the human element in translation. He shares his recent experiences at PodFest 2025, where he engaged with fellow broadcasters and delved into the transformative role of podcasting as a modern communication medium. Jason's insights illuminate how podcasting, much like radio before it, can shape public discourse, but he also cautions against its potential for polarization, mirroring the current political climate.

The conversation naturally transitions to the challenges posed by misinformation, particularly in the medical field. Jason asserts that there is a pressing need for professionals to translate complex medical jargon into accessible language for the general public. This necessity is underscored by the concerning trend of public distrust in established scientific authorities, amplified by political decisions and the rise of conspiracy theories. The episode highlights the vital role that communication specialists play in bridging these gaps, ensuring that crucial information reaches those who need it most.

As the episode wraps up, Jason shares his philosophy on continuous learning and networking, stressing the importance of building relationships within the industry. He describes how attending events like PodFest not only fosters personal growth but also facilitates connections that can lead to collaborative opportunities. The insights shared in this episode serve as a roadmap for professionals navigating the evolving landscape of work, emphasizing a proactive approach to embracing technology while prioritizing human connections and effective communication.

Takeaways:

*  The future of work involves human-supervised AI, enhancing productivity without replacing human roles.
*  Language is evolving rapidly; colloquial language changes faster than technical language, impacting communication.
*  Networking at events is crucial for personal and professional growth; face-to-face connections matter.
*  AI should be seen as a tool to improve efficiency, not as a job threat.
*  Translators must adapt to using AI tools to increase their productivity and output.
*  Emotional health and time management are key to preventing burnout in solopreneurs.

Hi, I'm Jesse Hirsch.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:03

Welcome to Meta Views, recorded live in front of an automated audience.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:11

And today we're going to get into a subject which is kind of in our wheelhouse on Metabuse.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:17

But I think our guest today, Jason Willis Lee, is going to address the future of work with some nuance and insights that are often not present when people talk about the future of work.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:31

But Jason, we like to start every segment of our show with the news.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:37

And this is partly because Metaviews has a daily newsletter.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:41

And right off the start, Jason, let me say that you are clearly the best guest that we've had on our podcast.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:47

Cuz you were so kind as to subscribe to our newsletter before joining us today.

Jesse Hirsch 00:00:53

And we were kind of talking about the political impact of the pardons that Donald Trump has just passed.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:01

But in particular, Jason, the reason we have this segment is we like to throw to our guest and say, is there any news that you would like to share, whether personal, whether world news, whether local news, where it's really designed to be an intuitive response.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:18

We kind of want to throw our guest onto the back of their feet.

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:22

But what are you thinking about?

Jesse Hirsch 00:01:24

What are you looking at that you think our audience should know more about?

Jason Willis Lee 00:01:29

Thank you, Jesse.

Jason Willis Lee 00:01:30

Thank you for having me.

Jason Willis Lee 00:01:31

I've got podcasting on the Mind.

Jason Willis Lee 00:01:32

Actually.

Jason Willis Lee 00:01:33

I'm fresh back from PodFest 2025.

Jason Willis Lee 00:01:36

I've been in Orlando, I live in Madrid, so taking a plane over to Orlando was a big.

Jason Willis Lee 00:01:42

Excuse me, a big, A big step for me.

Jason Willis Lee 00:01:45

So I realize you very clearly have a background in broadcasting and I was with some broadcasters there.

Jason Willis Lee 00:01:54

I just got podcasting on the Mind.

Jason Willis Lee 00:01:56

I was there last week and here I am on your podcast.

Jason Willis Lee 00:01:59

Thank you for having.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:00

And it's just very, very interesting, the use of audio and the use of audio as a radiophonic almost, I guess podcast is the successor to radio.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:11

I did meet a couple of former radio presenters and they were in their early 60s, mid-60s, even a bit older, and someone who never really touched this, this area.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:21

It's just very interesting for me to, to be on shows, Jesse, and talk about my work and the future of work and AI and all the things that are topical and we're talking about.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:32

I did see the inauguration.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:34

I got out of the US on the day Trump was inaugurated.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:38

So I thought, wow, I just got out on the day.

Jesse Hirsch 00:02:40

Good timing.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:40

So that was good timing.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:41

Exactly.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:42

I flew out of Philadelphia just a few hours before he was.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:46

So I'm not exactly sure who he's pardoned and who he hasn't pardoned.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:49

But I would say that I think the US Is very.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:53

Or North America in general.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:54

The US in particular is very polarized.

Jason Willis Lee 00:02:57

I mean, it's split down the middle, and maybe the world is polarized.

Jason Willis Lee 00:03:00

Is that a fair comment between the two camps, you know, the socialists, the lefties on the one side, and the.

Jason Willis Lee 00:03:06

The righties or the far righties sort of clawing their way into power.

Jason Willis Lee 00:03:12

I do think it's dangerous having someone like Elon Musk, such a wealthy person in power.

Jason Willis Lee 00:03:18

He's clearly financing bankrolling Trump's campaign.

Jason Willis Lee 00:03:21

And, you know, that looked very much like a fascist salute to me that he was giving.

Jason Willis Lee 00:03:25

So I think these are some dangerous people and we need checks and balances on power, Jesse, to keep these people in check.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:34

Absolutely.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:35

And I agree with you that podcasting is having this real moment and it is absolutely the successor to radio.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:41

And once you said that, the historian in me kind of had this insight that of course, Hitler's rise was because of the medium of radio.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:51

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:52

He was a very effective orator and radio broadcaster.

Jesse Hirsch 00:03:56

And in the 1930s, all around the world, but especially in Germany, radio acted as this kind of tribal drum, you know, beating up, beating this sense of violence.

Jesse Hirsch 00:04:08

And I wonder if podcasting has a similar dark side because, you know, podcasting played a huge role in the American election and where the United States right wing politics often owed its origins to talk radio and AM radio in the United States, that seems to be evolving in podcasting.

Jesse Hirsch 00:04:29

Although hopefully podcasting allows for a greater diversity of voices.

Jesse Hirsch 00:04:33

Cause unlike radio, there's no barrier to entry.

Jesse Hirsch 00:04:37

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:04:37

Anyone can start podcasting.

Jesse Hirsch 00:04:39

And so in that sense, I see a light amidst these very scary times in terms of the polarization.

Jesse Hirsch 00:04:46

And while we have limited time today, I at some point do wanna ask you about Spanish politics because I find it fascinating and I think North Americans know very little about it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:04:58

But our second segment on every metaview show is wtf or what's the Future?

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:06

Because we are a future centric podcast and we'd like to invite our guests to kind of share what's on their event horizon.

Jason Willis Lee 00:05:15

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:15

Like, what are you looking at, Jason?

Jesse Hirsch 00:05:17

What do you see either near term or long term future that you think our guests should also be paying attention to?

Jason Willis Lee 00:05:25

Yeah, that's a great question, Jesse.

Jason Willis Lee 00:05:27

So I work in the online language service provision business.

Jason Willis Lee 00:05:30

I am first and foremost a medical translator.

Jason Willis Lee 00:05:32

I make my living translating medicine from French and Spanish to English.

Jason Willis Lee 00:05:36

I started out as a doctor, so that's how I got into that field.

Jason Willis Lee 00:05:41

Now I'm branching into entrepreneurship and things interesting and fun things like podcasting and, you know, I agree.

Jason Willis Lee 00:05:47

I think it's a very interesting field.

Jason Willis Lee 00:05:49

And look at these big podcasts.

Jason Willis Lee 00:05:51

Joe Rogan that Trump was on, I agree, was a big decisive influence in the election.

Jason Willis Lee 00:05:56

I follow an influencer, Jesse, called Daniel Priestley.

Jason Willis Lee 00:05:59

He's the head of Dent Global and he teaches.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:02

He's been on a couple of podcasts.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:05

Diary of a CEO with Stephen Bartlett is a big, big show.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:09

Ramit Sethi was on recently as well.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:11

So he teaches us a strategy of just this sort of pyramid of getting onto the.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:16

The bottom shows with the lower audience and then just working your way up, up onto those, you know, Steve Bartlett's and Joe Rogan shows, just increasing the audience.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:25

In terms of the future of work, Jesse, I think I'm looking at an industry.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:29

I'm.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:29

I'm.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:30

I like to think of myself as a thought leader.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:32

I don't know if I.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:33

That's not for me to say.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:34

It's rather to.

Jesse Hirsch 00:06:35

I like, validate.

Jesse Hirsch 00:06:36

No, no, no, Jason, I'll validate.

Jesse Hirsch 00:06:38

Congratulations.

Jesse Hirsch 00:06:39

Metaviews has recognized you as a certified thought leader.

Jesse Hirsch 00:06:43

Please continue.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:44

That's so kind of you.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:45

Thank you.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:46

I think the future of my industry is human supervised AI output.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:51

So, Jesse, we work a lot on supervising machine output, whether that be chatgpt or integrated with CAT tools.

Jason Willis Lee 00:06:58

CAT meaning computer assisted translation.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:00

So I teach what.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:02

I'm still developing an authority framework to teach people, but it is loosely based around standalone personal branding.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:09

So, you know, very fantastic visibility of your online assets.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:12

How do you stand out?

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:13

I'll give you an example of how someone stood out.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:15

In PodFest 25, there was a wonderful man called Larry Roberts, and he had a company called Red Hat Media, and sure enough, he had a red baseball cap on.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:25

And, Jesse, how do you stand out in a field of 1800 people in a hotel in Florida?

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:30

You wear a red hat.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:32

So this guy stood out for me, and he was one of the most interesting people.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:35

I think I saw that because that is standalone branding, by just putting on a red cap.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:41

So I wrote to him and I said, look, I'm so happy to meet you.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:43

And, you know, these connections you get from the corridors, Jesse, are just incredible.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:48

They're just like gold dust.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:50

You can't.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:50

You know, whatever session I went to, it paled into insignificance in the conversations I had in the hallways and all these amazing American friends.

Jason Willis Lee 00:07:59

And of course, I invited everyone over to Spain.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:01

I mean, if you come over to Madrid, I'll happily host you.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:04

Spanish politics is as divisive as American politics.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:08

It is as polarized.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:09

It is the right and far right on one side and the left and far left on.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:13

On the other side.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:13

It is a left wing government, but it is a bit of a minority government.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:17

He lost a popular vote.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:18

So although we don't have an electoral college, we kind of feel as if we do because he got less votes than the other guy, but managed to swing the election just because of these decisive minority party votes that swing it.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:30

So it's the sort of country where you think, is this serious.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:34

I mean, you want strong things on foreign policy, education and health.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:38

But every change of government, Jesse, you get them unwinding everything, just ratcheting back everything the previous guy did.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:46

And I think what you need is solid pillars of common foreign security policy, education, health, regardless of what color government is in power.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:55

Right.

Jason Willis Lee 00:08:55

You want these things that are, we want good schools for our kids, we want good hospitals if we get sick, and we want to feel safe.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:01

I mean, the government's number one primary purpose is to keep us safe.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:05

Right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:09:06

Yeah.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:06

So I would say it's as divisive as over in your side of the Atlantic.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:12

And I was very nervous about this trip, Jesse.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:16

It's been 20 years since I went to America.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:18

The last time was my honeymoon with my wife for coming up to 20 years marriage.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:23

And I was nervous about traveling so far for work.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:26

I mean, this is crazy because I normally would go to a local conference in Barcelona or London or, you know, that would be normal.

Jesse Hirsch 00:09:32

Which you could take the train, too.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:34

Exactly.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:35

I could almost get the train to.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:36

Exactly.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:37

I could just go to Brussels and get the Eurotunnel over to Waterloo.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:41

So, you know, that was a big sort of mindset shift.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:45

I was feeling nervous and the night before I didn't sleep and.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:48

Oh, my gosh.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:48

But it was such an interesting trip, Jesse.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:52

And I know you live on a farm.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:54

And I met an entrepreneur who's also a farmer when I was in another event.

Jason Willis Lee 00:09:58

I was at an event called the Long Haul Leader in November, and I met a wonderful entrepreneur called Ryan Levesque.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:03

He is the father of quiz marketing.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:05

He's the father of the Ask Method and many books, many very, very influential leader, fantastic masterminds.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:12

And he lives on a farm in Vermont.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:15

And he just told a very, very interesting story.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:18

His Keenab was called Zig When They Zag.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:20

So his idea of people are running to the left, you run to the right.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:24

People are investing in this direction.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:26

There's probably an ROI in this direction.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:29

And that was, again, another meeting.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:30

That was three months ago, a couple of months ago.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:32

And that was another very influential meeting.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:34

So if anyone's listening to this, wondering whether it's worth it, the time and the resources going to an event, absolutely.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:41

Just don't think about it.

Jason Willis Lee 00:10:42

Just sign the check and get out there.

Jesse Hirsch 00:10:45

And your metric of when the conversations in the hallway are better than the sessions on the stage, that.

Jesse Hirsch 00:10:50

That's not a criticism of the sessions of the stage.

Jesse Hirsch 00:10:53

It's more an affirmation of how great that event is.

Jesse Hirsch 00:10:56

And it is tragic that we are having this conversation now and not a few weeks ago, because I just booked a flight via Madrid, which I could have had a stopover.

Jesse Hirsch 00:11:07

So, unfortunately, the way I'm going to Tenerife for an event, I'm not able to do the stopover.

Jesse Hirsch 00:11:15

But I will be taking you up on your offer.

Jesse Hirsch 00:11:17

And further, I think I have to have you back on this episode in the future just so we can do a deep dive into Spanish politics, because, as you mentioned, it is complicated, and I focused a lot on Catalonia and Barcelona, and that independence movement has kind of died down, but it still, to your point, has an influence on federal politics.

Jesse Hirsch 00:11:39

So, again, let's bookmark that for later, because today's conversation, and as I mentioned at the outset, the future of work is something that we have talked about here at Metaviews quite a bit, partly because I have found a lot of the predictions around the future of work to be nonsense, to really not be rooted in either empiricism or in critical thinking.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:03

But you said something that I thought made me go, yes, this is exactly why I want Jason to talk about the future of work, the human supervised, and the extent to which a lot of the prophecies around AI that displace the human are.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:18

Aren't going to work, because you fundamentally need to have that human in the loop.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:22

And before we talk about that, I kind of want to set the grounds by talking about language, because I think that's another area where most people don't really understand what language is and how it operates.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:36

And it was interesting.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:37

You talk about how you were or still are, to a certain extent, a doctor.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:41

That's how you are able to do medical translation.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:44

Let's just start with the act of translating medicine from jargon to the layperson, from the professional language to the more accessible language, because it strikes me that is a form of translation.

Jesse Hirsch 00:12:58

And I say this in the sense of setting you up for a really broad and philosophical question.

Jesse Hirsch 00:13:05

How is language changing in our current contemporary moment?

Jesse Hirsch 00:13:10

Because it strikes me it is on a real fundamental level.

Jesse Hirsch 00:13:13

And I'm curious whether you agree and how you view our current relationship with language.

Jason Willis Lee 00:13:22

Yeah, that's an amazing question for an applied linguist, Jesse.

Jason Willis Lee 00:13:25

I think language is always evolving.

Jason Willis Lee 00:13:27

What I'm going to say is that colloquial language probably evolves faster than technical language.

Jason Willis Lee 00:13:34

So the kind of documents that I see are unlikely to change that too much.

Jason Willis Lee 00:13:39

I'm diving into medical reports, clinical trial documents, protocols, summary of product characteristics, these types of things.

Jason Willis Lee 00:13:46

For drugs, those things are pretty much black and white.

Jason Willis Lee 00:13:49

It's either this or it isn't.

Jason Willis Lee 00:13:51

And you've got to get it right otherwise, that sort of thing.

Jason Willis Lee 00:13:55

It's difficult to train the robots and large language models to do those sorts of translations.

Jason Willis Lee 00:14:01

So I guess I'm fortunate in that way.

Jason Willis Lee 00:14:03

So the message for anyone considering a career as a linguist, I mean, don't fret.

Jason Willis Lee 00:14:07

AI is not taking your job.

Jason Willis Lee 00:14:09

There is as much work supervising AI as there was before, if not more so.

Jason Willis Lee 00:14:14

So it's an opportunity for productivity.

Jason Willis Lee 00:14:16

You can go faster and you will always be in need.

Jason Willis Lee 00:14:19

If you have a niche, Jesse, you have to niche down.

Jason Willis Lee 00:14:22

You've got a niche down into medicine, as I did law, finance, art, history.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:27

Although let me push back a bit because I agree that the language of niches within marketing is logical.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:34

But I'm going to disagree and say I'm not sure medicine is a niche.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:38

I think you have a specialization, but medicine itself is still very general.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:42

There are all sorts of schools and practices and disciplines within medicine.

Jesse Hirsch 00:14:48

So while you are distinguishing yourself and specializing, there is still a kind of generalist approach, is there not?

Jason Willis Lee 00:14:56

I think there is a generalist approach.

Jason Willis Lee 00:14:58

There would be what I would call sub niches within the generalism.

Jason Willis Lee 00:15:01

So like oncology or oncology, cardiology, those would be the sort of super specialisms within the specialism.

Jason Willis Lee 00:15:10

I mean, I spend my time on clinical trials, medical reports, journal articles, where I help author clients, you know, do a bit of consultancy, almost bridge between the author clients and the journal.

Jason Willis Lee 00:15:21

Free journals are always saying they can't, they can't publish because they're free.

Jason Willis Lee 00:15:24

The paid journals are, you know, expensive and the quicker publication cycles, that.

Jason Willis Lee 00:15:28

That's my kind of conversation with my clients.

Jason Willis Lee 00:15:31

But yeah, the future, the future is to lean into AI, I think, I think too many people are afraid of AI, Jesse.

Jason Willis Lee 00:15:38

They've been leaving the industry, they've been going back to employment.

Jason Willis Lee 00:15:40

And that, I think is the wrong thing to do.

Jason Willis Lee 00:15:44

I've been self employed 20 years.

Jason Willis Lee 00:15:46

I just could not imagine today going back to work for someone and not having the freedom of doing my own schedule and picking my clients.

Jason Willis Lee 00:15:56

I'll be 50 in a few months time.

Jason Willis Lee 00:15:58

So I'm about to enter a different phase of my life, the last 10 or 15 years of my career.

Jason Willis Lee 00:16:03

So that's an interesting no.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:06

Let me push back there.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:07

As someone who just turned 50, I hate to tell you this.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:10

We may have multiple decades of our career ahead of us, given the nature of the society we face, combined with revolutions in medicine that could allow us to lead healthier last quarters of our lives.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:24

Absolutely.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:25

And I kind of at the start was joking, but not joking about translating professional language into layperson's terms because again, politically, we have seen an assault on science.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:37

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:37

An assault on medicine even.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:40

And the Trump administration withdrawing from the World Health Organization is not isolated.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:46

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:47

It's part of a larger kind of push against established scientific authorities.

Jesse Hirsch 00:16:54

So to what extent when you deal with your clients, are you not just having to help them translate between languages, but be more accessible?

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:03

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:04

And anticipate the kind of conspiracy and disinformation that targets medical knowledge and targets medical information and that a lot of the researchers who look at conspiracy say we need to make medical information more accessible, we need to make it more available to the layperson.

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:24

Has that been reaching your clients?

Jesse Hirsch 00:17:26

Are they starting to get a sense that they also need a communicator like yourself, not just to translate between languages, but to help them make their research, their findings, their ideas and arguments more accessible?

Jason Willis Lee 00:17:40

I think that's a great question.

Jason Willis Lee 00:17:42

It comes down to using English as the sort of common language.

Jason Willis Lee 00:17:47

So the language of most researchers is English.

Jason Willis Lee 00:17:50

So I will help people with poor English who write in Spanish.

Jason Willis Lee 00:17:53

Of course, many clients write in English and are good enough to do that.

Jason Willis Lee 00:17:56

And it becomes an editing job.

Jason Willis Lee 00:17:58

Of course, AI has made editing, has given a premium on editing because we're now editing more than translating.

Jason Willis Lee 00:18:04

I think Trump's decision to leave the W H O that is purely a MAGA movement decision.

Jason Willis Lee 00:18:12

It is a Trump first, an America first thing that has bad news for global trade.

Jason Willis Lee 00:18:18

Let's hope, you know, God forbid it doesn't, you know, flare up in another pandemic, God forbid in another 100 years.

Jason Willis Lee 00:18:23

That's a once in a century event.

Jason Willis Lee 00:18:26

So I think, although I got to.

Jesse Hirsch 00:18:29

Push back there too, because I think it was a once in a century event.

Jesse Hirsch 00:18:34

My friends in epidemiology are suggesting, thanks to climate change, thanks to globalized trade.

Jesse Hirsch 00:18:41

The way in which such things spread could mean that it's more than once a century.

Jesse Hirsch 00:18:46

But please continue.

Jason Willis Lee 00:18:47

No, I sincerely hope it is because that means that in our lifetimes we're not going to see another pandemic.

Jason Willis Lee 00:18:54

Hopefully.

Jason Willis Lee 00:18:54

It sounds like we're very similar ages.

Jason Willis Lee 00:18:57

So, yeah, I think communication is.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:00

I mean, I could say instead of medical translator, I'm a professional communication specialist.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:05

I mean, that is what we do.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:06

We help.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:07

We help clients communicate.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:09

It may not be medicine.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:10

It may be a press release for a private equity firm.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:13

It may be a.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:14

I don't know, a clinical trial protocol.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:16

It may be a deed of property, you know, for the legal translators out there, a property deed or a last will and testament.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:22

So I think communicating is.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:24

Will always be the case.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:26

And multi.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:27

Multilingual communication, if you have a couple of languages, and mine are pretty standard.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:31

I mean, French and Spanish is as pretty standard as you go, Jesse.

Jason Willis Lee 00:19:34

But I've been lucky in that I have this strong niche, the medicine or the niche within the niche, as you said, that I've been able to string together a fairly interesting career.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:44

Well, and now that we have successfully infected you with the title of thought leader and you've recognized that your ideas, quite frankly, are worth sharing as wide and far as possible.

Jesse Hirsch 00:19:57

I affirm your point about AI.

Jesse Hirsch 00:20:00

I feel that there is a deliberate attempt to induce fear around AI because it's such an accessible tool.

Jesse Hirsch 00:20:08

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:20:09

Because it is such a powerful and accessible tool.

Jesse Hirsch 00:20:12

And again, to use political language.

Jesse Hirsch 00:20:13

I remember as a child when the means of production were not even within my reach.

Jesse Hirsch 00:20:19

I couldn't imagine making radio, couldn't imagine doing a podcast like we're doing now.

Jesse Hirsch 00:20:24

But AI allows me to both be a farmer and a podcaster because it makes a lot of the production.

Jesse Hirsch 00:20:31

It allows me, for example, to take this video that we're producing, the audio that we're producing, put it into clips and upload it to TikTok, and then TikTok's AI will promote it to other people who want to learn about these subjects.

Jesse Hirsch 00:20:44

So tell me a bit more about the way in which to use our language, the way in which you're excited about AI as a translator, as a professional communicator.

Jesse Hirsch 00:20:54

What are the things that you would tell to other people that are exciting and are sort of the opposite of the fear, but should be engendering curiosity and experimentation?

Jason Willis Lee 00:21:05

I am convinced that AI can be used to enhance productivity.

Jason Willis Lee 00:21:09

I think if we lean into AI, we can use.

Jason Willis Lee 00:21:12

So I'm talking about chatgpt Copilot Claude Whatever these, these engines are, they're all pretty much the same.

Jason Willis Lee 00:21:18

They can produce images that they're great for content creators, but they're also good for service provision as well.

Jason Willis Lee 00:21:24

So I think service, the service provision industry, and this goes as much for translation as real estate as law, needs to just feel more comfortable with AI.

Jason Willis Lee 00:21:34

And I think we are.

Jason Willis Lee 00:21:35

I'm seeing thought is in MySpace teaching us how, you know, we're seeing things like AI and translation and how to use it.

Jason Willis Lee 00:21:43

And we've got somebody who's built a cat tool, a computer assisted translation tool that integrates ChatGPT.

Jason Willis Lee 00:21:48

And that's genius because that's exactly what the market is asking for, a hybrid human AI solution.

Jason Willis Lee 00:21:55

So that's genius.

Jason Willis Lee 00:21:57

So I think if people just get to grips with this work smarter, not harder philosophy, Jesse, to use it for enhanced productivity, then that's certainly the way ahead for the next five years.

Jason Willis Lee 00:22:07

That's, that's my plan.

Jason Willis Lee 00:22:09

I don't want to stop translating.

Jason Willis Lee 00:22:10

I mean, even if consultancy goes really well for me and a thousand people buy the book behind me and they come onto my courses and, you know, it's all fantastic, I still want to feel useful as a translator.

Jason Willis Lee 00:22:20

That's my bread and butter, you know, job.

Jason Willis Lee 00:22:22

And I don't think I'll ever stop translating for my clients unless, you know, so many points are going to my head and tells me not to.

Jesse Hirsch 00:22:30

Even then, one might be tempted to find a way to get that gun removed.

Jesse Hirsch 00:22:36

What I really like about your kind of message, and this gets back to why I think the future of work is often an elusive prediction that people make.

Jesse Hirsch 00:22:47

You've placed the human at the center of it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:22:50

You are very clear to your fellow translators, your colleagues in the industry, that they don't have to fear losing their job, that what it is, is their job is changing and to your point, potentially becoming more productive, therefore more prosperous.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:05

Why don't you unpack that further in terms of what you see as the future of work and your own kind of role in it.

Jesse Hirsch 00:23:12

Given that you said we all kind of want to feel useful, we want to have a kind of purpose to life and maybe that's changing, as you mentioned, from translation to more editing to more consulting.

Jason Willis Lee 00:23:23

So to get specific, Jesse, let's say we have a 7,000 word article.

Jason Willis Lee 00:23:28

I mean, normally this would take several hours, five or six hours work.

Jason Willis Lee 00:23:32

I believe with AI this could be done in less than two hours to get a fairly rough draft.

Jason Willis Lee 00:23:38

I mean, obviously this needs to be read through and revised and edited.

Jason Willis Lee 00:23:41

But I think that's a marvelous.

Jason Willis Lee 00:23:43

So that's effectively doubling your productivity so you can actually double your output, double your revenue by just leveraging the tool.

Jason Willis Lee 00:23:51

And I'm not, I'm certainly not saying you should just, you know, press the button and leave it to translate and hand that in.

Jason Willis Lee 00:23:56

That's, that, that would be irresponsible.

Jason Willis Lee 00:23:59

But I am saying it's just there as a, as a little helper to.

Jason Willis Lee 00:24:02

And you know, I'm seeing, I'm seeing AI apps as well, Jesse, to help us with our sales.

Jason Willis Lee 00:24:07

So let's say we're a translation business wanting to sell more to pharma companies in the US well we can program an app to sort of filter our leads and just ask a series of questions that will make life easier for our sales representative to get the warmer lead and hopefully easier to close a deal on those calls.

Jason Willis Lee 00:24:24

So I'm seeing marvelous applications of AI.

Jason Willis Lee 00:24:27

It is affecting every industry.

Jason Willis Lee 00:24:29

This was coming, I mean I remember machine translation five or ten years ago.

Jason Willis Lee 00:24:33

I wouldn't touch it with a barge bolt.

Jason Willis Lee 00:24:35

I just thought it was so inferior to the humans.

Jason Willis Lee 00:24:38

And here we are 10 years later and I'm using it daily, I use it daily for content creation work because I build an audience and micro community around my, around my message, around my authority framework what I hope will be authoritative soon enough.

Jason Willis Lee 00:24:52

And I think AI is a good thing.

Jason Willis Lee 00:24:55

Of course it causes some destruction but it also creates a lot of opportunity.

Jason Willis Lee 00:24:58

I don't think there's ever destruction without.

Jason Willis Lee 00:25:00

It's a sort of balanced hybrid arrangements between some things go and some opportunities come.

Jason Willis Lee 00:25:07

I believe there are unicorn opportunities Jesse, that just come, come along once in a, once in a career lifetime or once in a blue moon and you have to jump on these opportunities whilst they can and, and that can be life changing.

Jason Willis Lee 00:25:18

That can change your life.

Jason Willis Lee 00:25:19

I mean somebody spoke a podfest to who did jump on.

Jason Willis Lee 00:25:22

I believe it was Red Hat Media, Larry Roberts, the, the gentleman I told you about and he that was meeting the, the event organizer of Pub Festival and that changed his life.

Jason Willis Lee 00:25:32

So I think you can have these life changing events and we need to jump on these opportunities whenever they arise.

Jesse Hirsch 00:25:40

Well and the kind of implicit vision that I'm hearing there is one of learning.

Jesse Hirsch 00:25:45

Because on the one hand you're describing how AI is evolving, right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:25:49

How five years ago the translation capabilities were really not ready for prime time versus now they've advanced quite substantially.

Jesse Hirsch 00:25:57

But it sounds like you over that period also kind of advanced and evolved.

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:03

Allow me to Kind of make this more.

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:05

As a personal question, which you're welcome to elaborate into a larger framework, but what is your learning strategy?

Jesse Hirsch 00:26:12

How do you, as a professional, a seasoned professional as I am, how do you integrate learning into your professional activities and ensure that you're kind of always growing and evolving as the culture and marketplace around you does as well?

Jason Willis Lee 00:26:30

Well, yeah, that's a great question, Jesse.

Jason Willis Lee 00:26:32

I think CPD continuous professional development for me is a big, big.

Jason Willis Lee 00:26:36

It's a big one.

Jason Willis Lee 00:26:37

I do events, I do events where, where either, you know, I'm usually learning.

Jason Willis Lee 00:26:41

I'm going to the podfest event was a huge learning exercise for me as a, as a first time podcaster.

Jason Willis Lee 00:26:46

I've had a show on the air for two years.

Jason Willis Lee 00:26:48

But yeah, it needs, it needs building out, it needs monetizing, it needs a bit of strategy behind it.

Jason Willis Lee 00:26:53

So I was just in my element at this event.

Jason Willis Lee 00:26:56

But I, I'm very intellectually curious, I would say describe myself as if I want to know everything about a topic, I'll just read everything I can find about whatever that topic is, whether that's for my personal life or for work.

Jason Willis Lee 00:27:11

And I think you just have to have this intellectual curiosity to do that.

Jason Willis Lee 00:27:17

The other aspect of course, is networking.

Jason Willis Lee 00:27:19

You need to build a VIP network of people.

Jason Willis Lee 00:27:21

Did I speak to every person at an 1800 person event?

Jason Willis Lee 00:27:24

Of course not.

Jason Willis Lee 00:27:25

I spent to a handful of people and I had deeper connections and deeper conversations that I would never get online.

Jason Willis Lee 00:27:31

Jesse.

Jason Willis Lee 00:27:32

I would never get these conversations.

Jason Willis Lee 00:27:34

I mean, we're having a pretty good conversation now because we're curating a video, we're producing some content which will hopefully be of use to someone.

Jason Willis Lee 00:27:42

Maybe someone's thinking of going into the language industry, who knows?

Jason Willis Lee 00:27:46

But I think it's about the networking and that's something you cannot get online.

Jason Willis Lee 00:27:51

So I would encourage all of you listening to this to get out to those events, find out where the influences are, which water coolers do they hang out with, get to those events and invest the time and money.

Jason Willis Lee 00:28:02

I promise you, you will see a return on your investment.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:05

So let me push on that a little and more extending that argument even further.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:11

As someone who is both an entrepreneur but is also encouraging entrepreneurs and who's working with different businesses, certainly on a language or linguistic level.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:22

To what extent do you think events should be part of their strategy?

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:26

And I don't mean attending events, I mean organizing their own.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:30

Because we're having, we started our conversation by saying we're participating in the evolution of radio, right?

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:37

And the new version of radio.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:39

But it strikes me the parallel is with events, because I agree with you entirely.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:43

Going to events in person and connecting with people in person is second to none.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:48

I mean, I am fundamentally an event professional.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:51

I go and speak to those events.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:53

But I also think second to that there is potential in virtual events.

Jesse Hirsch 00:28:57

There is potential, especially given the cost of say going from Madrid to Florida or doing that kind of traveling.

Jesse Hirsch 00:29:06

I'm curious what your thoughts are again on events as a commercial strategy, both in person and virtual, because you're kind of making that argument indirectly on an individual level.

Jesse Hirsch 00:29:18

I'm curious if you want to elevate that to an organizational or commercial level because it sounds like it works not just for the individual attending events, but there's kind of power in the convener of hosting and facilitating these events when no one else is.

Jason Willis Lee 00:29:34

I think live events is a very, very good strategy to build influence.

Jason Willis Lee 00:29:39

I also think it is very good to co host events with another influencer if you could find someone in the industry with you.

Jason Willis Lee 00:29:48

And I've attempted to do this with one, with one person who manufactured some software, has a software as a service company and he's struggling with some of the things I'm struggling about messaging and getting across to people.

Jason Willis Lee 00:30:00

Just investing in themselves I think is a big, is a big problem we all have, Jesse, is this personal development and just willingness to invest in ourselves and move ourselves forwards faster.

Jason Willis Lee 00:30:11

Find that mentor, find that strategy, whatever it is to invest in.

Jason Willis Lee 00:30:15

So I think events, live events, as you said, second to none.

Jason Willis Lee 00:30:19

And if you can be the host of that live event and you know, some, some people, their full time job is organizing a live, a live event.

Jason Willis Lee 00:30:27

I mean the, the founder of PodFest, Chris Grimistos, I think he, this is his full time job, this is what he does from, from day in, day out.

Jason Willis Lee 00:30:34

So if you can, in your, within your industry position yourself as the thought leader who has an event.

Jason Willis Lee 00:30:40

I mean mine would be called the entrepreneurial translator or something along those lines.

Jason Willis Lee 00:30:45

Just teaching freelance translators or online language service providers to think as small business owners.

Jason Willis Lee 00:30:52

Just this mindset shift, I think that's a wonderful strategy to maintain competitiveness and relevance in the years ahead.

Jesse Hirsch 00:31:01

So one of the things I feel that is a subtext of what we've been describing today in the context of the future of work is how we allocate our time and resources.

Jesse Hirsch 00:31:11

And you know, this is something I often struggle with because I wear so many hats.

Jesse Hirsch 00:31:15

And one thing I like actually about being a farmer, for example, this morning, it's exceptionally cold.

Jesse Hirsch 00:31:21

It's like minus 20 Celsius here.

Jesse Hirsch 00:31:23

And I had to go and dig a bale out of ice and bring it to the horses because they're eating way more food because it's really cold.

Jesse Hirsch 00:31:31

And that was an example where my time was easily allocated.

Jesse Hirsch 00:31:35

But the rest of the day I often struggle.

Jesse Hirsch 00:31:37

Like there'll be times where I prefer to create.

Jesse Hirsch 00:31:40

There are other times where I know I got to promote.

Jesse Hirsch 00:31:43

There are other times where I should be learning, There are other times I should be doing business development.

Jesse Hirsch 00:31:50

Where do you see within the future of work, within the role of AI, within the entrepreneurial mindset, the distribution of resources, of our time, of our attention?

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:02

Because it strikes me, you and I as intellectuals, we're sort of assuming, oh yeah, you got to do all these different things.

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:09

But I think a lot of people get overwhelmed.

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:12

This goes back to the folks who just want to go back to being an employee because they would rather someone else tell them what to do.

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:18

Because there are, it seems, so many different things that we have to so many different plates and balls we have to keep spinning.

Jesse Hirsch 00:32:25

So where do you see that within this discussion around the future of work, given the so many ways in which our attention can be stretched, captured, distracted, and yet there are also so many tasks that we need to divide our attention and resources amongst.

Jason Willis Lee 00:32:41

That's such a great question, Jesse.

Jason Willis Lee 00:32:43

The event where I met Ryan Levesque, where I was happy to meet him and he told the anecdote about a cow sort of squirting mucus in his face and him bursting out laughing.

Jason Willis Lee 00:32:53

That was at the Long Haul Leader Summit in Cambridge hosted by Chris Ducker.

Jason Willis Lee 00:32:57

He's a popular, you know, online mentor, business mentor.

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:00

And that event was all about anti burnout.

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:03

And I think one of the things as entrepreneurs or solopreneurs we have is this risk of burnout.

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:09

And there are so many tasks.

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:10

So what I, what I try and do and I'm successful to this, to a certain degree, is time blocking.

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:16

So I try and group activities together.

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:19

I'll do my service provision work in the morning because I'm freshest and that's the work, the billable hours.

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:25

And I'm very sort of a keen eye on the billable hours.

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:28

What activity is bringing in money, what isn't?

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:30

There's so many non billable hours.

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:32

Of course, there are coaching hours, there is marketing time and visit, business development time.

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:38

So I think time blocking is a useful strategy.

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:40

But more than the actual time blocking or time management, Jesse, it's this Anti burnout strategy.

Jason Willis Lee 00:33:46

If I could just get a lifestyle business off the ground, which I more or less have, I'm pretty much there working five or six hours a day, doing the morning shift eight to two, and then after lunch, which is now sort of time for me, it's just gone 4:30.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:00

That's a more sort of relaxed time when I would schedule podcast interviews and, you know, conversations where I, I need my, my, my, my wits about me, of course, but I, I'm unlikely to make a mistake.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:12

It's not the same as making a mistake in the document that might have serious consequences.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:16

Now if I, if I'm, if I'm tired after lunch and, you know, had a half a glass of wine or something.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:20

So I think, I think it's, it's a question of just being.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:25

Keeping an eye on your emotional health and your boundaries.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:28

I'm frequently asked by people outside of my time zone, the Canary Islands, just this week, you're going to Tenerife.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:34

I had a client in Grand Canary say, are you available at 6:00 to sort of, you know, if I have a question?

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:40

And I said, well, no, I have an appointment.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:42

And I was very firm on the boundary because she was clearly trying to organize something around her schedule and going to this meeting and then looking at it and then, you know, at 6:00, but that's, you know, or earlier.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:52

I'm out of there.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:53

I don't want to be talking about work.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:54

I want to be with my family.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:56

I've got two daughters, 17 and 15.

Jason Willis Lee 00:34:58

Just spend time with my wife, just chilling out, hanging out, watching some tennis.

Jason Willis Lee 00:35:01

I'm a big tennis fan.

Jason Willis Lee 00:35:03

So there are things I do outside of my work life that I enjoy and that I value, that recharge me, that recharge my emotions, my muscles.

Jason Willis Lee 00:35:13

Weekends, I'm unlikely to think about work until Sunday evening.

Jason Willis Lee 00:35:17

Then I'll plan my week out and I'll have a deep sort of think about my diary, look at it, all the calls that I have, and I think it's just getting organized.

Jason Willis Lee 00:35:26

Jesse I won't say I'm the most organized solopreneur out there, but it is fun for you to do that.

Jason Willis Lee 00:35:33

Yeah.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:34

Although it kind of evokes a larger cultural context, which I'll articulate as a more big picture question.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:41

The Spanish work culture has always been, I think, a greater balance between the, the human and the cog in the machine.

Jesse Hirsch 00:35:50

But there has been, I think, a lot of criticism from the rest of Europe, especially around the nature of the siesta and the timing of the Spanish workday, has that impacted.

Jesse Hirsch 00:36:01

Has Spanish work culture been compromised by the integration into the larger European market, or has it resisted that?

Jesse Hirsch 00:36:10

And is Spanish work culture still a precious balance between the home life and the work life?

Jason Willis Lee 00:36:17

Well, that's a very interesting point.

Jason Willis Lee 00:36:19

I think the siesta is a bit of a stereotype for me.

Jason Willis Lee 00:36:23

It refers more to the commercial shops not being open from 2 to 5, so you're unlikely to get service from 2 to 5, so you need to go after 5 and then possibly until 8.

Jason Willis Lee 00:36:32

There is also a productivity component.

Jason Willis Lee 00:36:35

You have this expression, calenta la silla.

Jason Willis Lee 00:36:38

Calenta la silla means just keeping the seat warm.

Jason Willis Lee 00:36:41

So this, this idea of being the first one in, the last one out.

Jason Willis Lee 00:36:44

And there, of course is a productivity.

Jason Willis Lee 00:36:46

People are just, just doing things de cara a la galleria, just for show, just to see, you know, for the boss to see.

Jason Willis Lee 00:36:53

You're there doing your hours.

Jason Willis Lee 00:36:55

That, to me suggests a very low productivity.

Jason Willis Lee 00:36:57

I feel you can be as productive in five or six hours a day than any employer can from 8 to 10.

Jason Willis Lee 00:37:03

And you surely agree with me on this.

Jason Willis Lee 00:37:06

And you have a very interesting hybrid lifestyle as well.

Jason Willis Lee 00:37:09

You've got your online corporate business activities, you've got your farm, and that's a wonderful lifestyle, hybrid lifestyle.

Jason Willis Lee 00:37:17

I think I'd like to just tip my hat to you on that and hugely admire.

Jesse Hirsch 00:37:21

I mean, this is one of the benefits North American culture that we have so much land, right, that, you know, compared to Europe, where every single piece of land has been spoken for for perhaps centuries, you know, here in North America, land is a little more accessible with respect to our indigenous and first nations brothers and sisters.

Jesse Hirsch 00:37:40

I do want to come to your.

Jesse Hirsch 00:37:42

But the other question that's kind of been brewing in my head throughout our conversation, which I will warn you is kind of coming out of completely left field.

Jesse Hirsch 00:37:50

But I want to throw you this curveball nonetheless to both indulge my own personal curiosity and see if I can provoke you as a thought leader into a comment or thought on the evolution of society.

Jesse Hirsch 00:38:05

I would love to hear you, for the benefit of our audience, break down the difference between translation and transliteration and whether the difference between translation and transliteration speaks to our social media society and the way in which things don't always translate, but instead are more an essence of transliteration.

Jesse Hirsch 00:38:28

If I might provoke you to kind of address that.

Jason Willis Lee 00:38:32

Well, translation is just simply a textual shift from say, Spanish to English.

Jason Willis Lee 00:38:38

That would just be so for a non Spanish speaking audience to understand something In English, I mean, more than transliteration.

Jason Willis Lee 00:38:46

I'm also thinking of transcreation, which is adapting something for a specific target audience.

Jason Willis Lee 00:38:53

So for example, an advertising text or localizing a piece of software, you might need different size boxes for the text.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:00

So that's more transcreation.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:01

Would that come under the same category as transliteration?

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:04

That's certainly a sub niche within my industry.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:08

But translation, of course, is.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:10

There is much more confusion, Jesse, between translation and interpreting.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:15

Some interpreters are wrongly called translators.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:18

They are interpreters.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:19

The person in the cabin with the headphones, as I have on now, interpreting with the source text coming in through one ear.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:25

You have to process it, listen to it and then get the target text.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:29

Excuse me, the target language out in the.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:31

In the same.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:32

All in the same process.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:33

So that is very challenging work.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:35

Very.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:36

Yeah.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:36

Normally you wouldn't work more than half an hour at a time and have be doing relay with someone else in the booth.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:42

But.

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:43

And is it the subjectivity that fundamentally is part of that rapid cognitive experience?

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:50

Is that part of the difference between.

Jesse Hirsch 00:39:52

Or are you just talking about the cognitive effort?

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:55

I'm talking about the cognitive effort.

Jason Willis Lee 00:39:56

I mean, bias is an issue, of course, in translation.

Jason Willis Lee 00:40:01

You can't go off making your own if you're translating.

Jason Willis Lee 00:40:04

If you're interpreting for Trump, you can't just go off and agree with him or disagree with him.

Jason Willis Lee 00:40:09

Your job is just to say what he's saying, but no one knows what he's saying.

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:13

That's such a great example.

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:15

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:16

He is so deliberately vague at times.

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:21

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:22

And speaks in abstract meaning dog whistle, that the news media has basically just become a conversation between the two.

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:32

Right.

Jesse Hirsch 00:40:33

So again, we're running out of time, but this, this is something that I.

Jason Willis Lee 00:40:37

Think just very quickly, I have heard of colleagues who have had trouble interpreting Trump because there's as probably with Biden as well.

Jason Willis Lee 00:40:45

I mean, these are elderly men who.

Jason Willis Lee 00:40:47

Whose expressive communication is perhaps not.

Jason Willis Lee 00:40:51

I mean, well, that's another.

Jason Willis Lee 00:40:52

A debate for another day.

Jason Willis Lee 00:40:53

Jesse.

Jason Willis Lee 00:40:53

Why?

Jason Willis Lee 00:40:54

What are octogenarians doing standing for the highest office in the land?

Jason Willis Lee 00:40:57

I mean, surely we have people our age or younger that can stand for office and be thought leaders and leaders in their own right.

Jason Willis Lee 00:41:04

Why are we concentrating on the age group of late 70s, early 80s?

Jason Willis Lee 00:41:08

To me, that's crazy.

Jason Willis Lee 00:41:09

As a European, as a Brit, I.

Jesse Hirsch 00:41:11

Understand that in the gerontocracy and the accumulation of power.

Jesse Hirsch 00:41:17

But as someone who aspires to be an octogenarian, I don't want to rule anything out just yet, but I do understand your logic.

Jesse Hirsch 00:41:25

Now, the final segment that we have on any show, which being the generous thought leader that you are, you've kind of already been doing it, is shout outs.

Jesse Hirsch 00:41:34

Is there anyone that you would like our audience to know more about that you would like them to look up?

Jesse Hirsch 00:41:42

Someone that you are following online that you think our audience should also be paying attention to?

Jason Willis Lee 00:41:48

Well, I'd like to shout out my current mentor.

Jason Willis Lee 00:41:51

I study business with a very nice lady called Susannah Ray.

Jason Willis Lee 00:41:55

R E A Y.

Jason Willis Lee 00:41:56

She has an online community called the Sparkspace.

Jason Willis Lee 00:41:59

And I'm learning, I'm learning lots from her.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:02

How to, how to, you know, how to run coaching calls, how to build my authority very easily, whether it's through a book or my, my online course.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:10

My just getting the messaging right so that I can blast it out on all the channels.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:14

I, I don't have separate content for each channel.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:17

I, I do what you do, I repurpose it.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:19

You said you repurpose videos for TikTok.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:21

I do the same for YouTube shorts.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:23

YouTube.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:24

I work LinkedIn and Instagram.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:25

That's where I play mainly.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:26

And I have the micro community there.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:28

And another person I follow quite frequently is Daniel Priestley.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:32

I mentioned him earlier.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:33

He's on the podcast guesting strategy, which is what I'm doing right now is to get on, get on podcast.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:41

And he's the founder of Dent Global.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:43

He's also the founder of some very nifty quiz software called ScoreApp.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:47

And this is a company whose valuation is in the tens of millions.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:52

And most of us use scoreApp quizzes to filter our leads and get our leads organized.

Jason Willis Lee 00:42:57

And those are two people I would just give a shout out to.

Jesse Hirsch 00:43:01

And finally, you are clearly a connoisseur of great events.

Jesse Hirsch 00:43:06

Do you share those events on your social feeds?

Jesse Hirsch 00:43:09

If we want to know where Jason's going or where Jason thinks we should be going.

Jesse Hirsch 00:43:14

How do we tap into that?

Jason Willis Lee 00:43:16

Yeah, so my next event, it's a local industry event in Barcelona.

Jason Willis Lee 00:43:21

It's called Elia Together, that's run by the European European Language Industry Association.

Jason Willis Lee 00:43:25

That's just a networking event, local for me, just two, two hours away, door to door.

Jason Willis Lee 00:43:30

And I live in very near the train station, so that's very local.

Jason Willis Lee 00:43:34

I will then be at a medical translation event in Cordoba at the end of April and that'll be specifically on medical translation.

Jason Willis Lee 00:43:42

So there are events within the specialism.

Jason Willis Lee 00:43:46

So anyone you know, interested in my industry can just pull up, pull up quite a few industry related events.

Jason Willis Lee 00:43:52

My next entrepreneurs event, I'm not quite sure when that will be.

Jason Willis Lee 00:43:56

That'll probably be.

Jason Willis Lee 00:43:57

I know there's another podcasting event in London.

Jason Willis Lee 00:43:59

I think it's Pod.

Jason Willis Lee 00:44:01

Pod.

Jason Willis Lee 00:44:02

It's not called podfest, it's called something else.

Jason Willis Lee 00:44:04

But it is in May, so possibly some of the people from from Pub Fest will be there.

Jason Willis Lee 00:44:09

But yeah, I have a mixture of events, some industry related and some more entrepreneur.

Jason Willis Lee 00:44:14

Entrepreneurial related.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:16

Right on.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:17

Well, thank you very much, Jason.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:18

As anticipated, this has been a fantastic conversation.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:23

Not just about the future of work, but about the cultural aspects that underpin the future of work.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:29

Whether AI, whether entrepreneurial, whether being a thought leader, working up the podcasting minor leagues to make it to the big time.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:38

Hopefully the big time.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:39

It's not Joe Rogan.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:40

Hopefully there's someone better soon so that your star moment can happen, perhaps with a better class and better character.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:48

This has been another episode of Meta Views.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:51

We love to platform people like Jason and help them reach a greater audience.

Jesse Hirsch 00:44:56

You can find us on all the socials and we'll be back soon.

Jesse Hirsch 00:45:01

Thanks again.
