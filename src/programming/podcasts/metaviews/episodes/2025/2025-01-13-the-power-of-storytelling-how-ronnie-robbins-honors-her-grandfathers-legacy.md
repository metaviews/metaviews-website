Hello and welcome to Metaviews, recorded live in front of an automated audience.

Jessie Hirsch 00:00:07

I'm your host, Jessie Hirsch, and I'm incredibly privileged today to have what I think is a fantastic guest, Ronnie Robbins, who's going to be talking about her novel Hands of Gold.

Jessie Hirsch 00:00:21

But of course, as with all episodes of Meta Views, we really like to have a dynamic way of engaging our guests and allowing our listeners to be.

Jessie Hirsch 00:00:32

We have a bunch of different segments that we like to go through and in particular, we always like to start with the news because I think the news these days are important.

Jessie Hirsch 00:00:44

And of course, at Metaviews we've got a newsletter and one of our big stories of the last little While has been TikTok, who we're still waiting for the Supreme Court to weigh in on whether TikTok is banned or not.

Jessie Hirsch 00:00:58

And that's been something here at Metaviews we've been watching very closely.

Jessie Hirsch 00:01:02

Now I often like to turn Ronnie to our guests and ask them if they have any thoughts.

Jessie Hirsch 00:01:09

Now we are going to talk about your journalism career, but before we get there, I'm kind of curious.

Jessie Hirsch 00:01:17

Do you have any thoughts on what's happening right now with TikTok?

Jessie Hirsch 00:01:20

Do you have any sense of which way this might go?

Ronnie Robbins 00:01:24

This is news to me about TikTok.

Ronnie Robbins 00:01:27

I'm not a big user of TikTok.

Ronnie Robbins 00:01:31

It's a younger media.

Ronnie Robbins 00:01:33

I think I'm sort of an old fashioned journalist.

Ronnie Robbins 00:01:38

But I did have my son do some TikToks about my book.

Ronnie Robbins 00:01:44

So I am on TikTok.

Ronnie Robbins 00:01:47

So I have to say that I'm ignorant about what's going on on TikTok.

Ronnie Robbins 00:01:53

I thought it was doing well.

Ronnie Robbins 00:01:54

I thought people liked it.

Ronnie Robbins 00:01:56

I thought the bigger issues were on X and, you know, the blue sky, switching to blue sky and people were all up in arms about Twitter, slash X.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:08

And I'm thinking people are getting frustrated with social media, period.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:14

I'm finding that people are turning to other media.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:18

So.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:19

And I would say, can I say LinkedIn and you know, I use Facebook and maybe that's.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:27

My generation uses Facebook and LinkedIn is getting a lot of attention, but I don't know about.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:34

For the young people, they still like TikTok or are they moving to blue sky?

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:39

I don't know.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:40

There seems to be a lot of frustration about social media in general and whether you should even disconnect from everything.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:47

My son is 27 and he's like, I gotta get off of this.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:51

You know, I'm.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:52

I don't know.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:53

You know, he's done A little bit.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:54

But Instagram I should mention too, people like Instagram, that's my world.

Ronnie Robbins 00:02:59

But I'm, I must be ignorant about TikTok.

Jessie Hirsch 00:03:02

Well, let me ask you a follow up question.

Jessie Hirsch 00:03:05

You know, assuming that you are a news consumer, where do you go for your news?

Jessie Hirsch 00:03:10

What's your kind of regular source to try to stay informed of what's happening?

Ronnie Robbins 00:03:15

Well, I don't want to give away too much politics here, so I'm all over the board, right?

Ronnie Robbins 00:03:20

So I'm cnn, I'm, I'm Washington Post, you know, mainstream media, I go to mainstream media.

Ronnie Robbins 00:03:31

I am a product of mainstream media and I trust mainstream media because they came from the same education that I came from in journalism back when, you know.

Ronnie Robbins 00:03:44

So all other media I don't trust.

Ronnie Robbins 00:03:48

Everyone's got an opinion, everyone puts it out there.

Ronnie Robbins 00:03:51

You got to check what if they're legitimate?

Ronnie Robbins 00:03:54

I mean, you can get it from all angles.

Ronnie Robbins 00:03:56

But for me, I still turn to mainstream media with the thought that those are trained journalists who are unbiased.

Ronnie Robbins 00:04:05

No, everyone will argue about this, but.

Jessie Hirsch 00:04:07

Let me ask you a follow up.

Jessie Hirsch 00:04:09

And here at Metaviews, we're very open and respectful about politics.

Jessie Hirsch 00:04:13

So I understand your point about not wanting to divulge your own leanings, but are there any particular journalists, are there any particular mainstream media people who you think are, let's say, more trustworthy than others, the ones who you tend to turn to?

Jessie Hirsch 00:04:27

And I ask this because one of our missions really at Metaviews is describe exactly what you described.

Jessie Hirsch 00:04:33

Finding those people we can trust, finding those people who kind of provide the signal amidst the noise.

Jessie Hirsch 00:04:39

And I think this is where you and I share a bit of a professional bias in terms of how the news industry, how journalism as a profession kind of creates not objective but credible commentary and reporting.

Jessie Hirsch 00:04:55

So I'm just curious, do you have any folks who come to mind that you like, that you trust, that you'd recommend to our audience?

Ronnie Robbins 00:05:03

Just gonna again reiterate.

Ronnie Robbins 00:05:05

Mainstream media, I don't want to call out anyone because, you know, I'm, I don't want to offend anyone.

Ronnie Robbins 00:05:14

I don't, I would just trust, I would, I would make your own judgments about who you trust.

Ronnie Robbins 00:05:22

You know, and it also depends, are you going to get confirmation of your own political feelings or not?

Ronnie Robbins 00:05:30

Are you wanting unbiased reporting?

Ronnie Robbins 00:05:34

From my vantage point, daily newspapers and the classic newspapers, there aren't very many of them, but those that have weathered the storm of all the competition that's come our way since everything went online and since the pandemic and in recent years, politically, you know, do you want unbiased reporting or do you want to just get confirmation of your own political leanings?

Jessie Hirsch 00:06:07

Well, and let's use that to kind of segue into our journalism theme, because I'd love to kind of ask you to reflect on both, if you don't mind disclosing kind of where you got started, right.

Jessie Hirsch 00:06:20

How you got into the industry.

Jessie Hirsch 00:06:22

But the question in particular that I'd love to get your reflection, your wisdom on is the contrast with now, how much has changed since when I assume you were young or relatively young and kind of getting into the business, because this is where I think a lot of young people don't have that perspective.

Jessie Hirsch 00:06:42

They don't have the especially because history, unfortunately, is no longer a subject that gets the attention it deserves.

Jessie Hirsch 00:06:51

But I want to hear your perspective on that contrast on kind of what you in your lifetime, the changes you've seen that has really, I think, both threatened the journalism as a profession, but are also putting pressures on it to either evolve or get back to its roots when it comes to the way in which it was practiced.

Jessie Hirsch 00:07:12

So I'd love to hear your thoughts of reflections on.

Ronnie Robbins 00:07:18

So I started out, I went to journalism school in the south and I grew up in the North.

Ronnie Robbins 00:07:26

So I should tell you that I grew up in New York.

Ronnie Robbins 00:07:29

So I actually started on my high school newspaper, my high school yearbook in New York, on Long Island.

Ronnie Robbins 00:07:39

And so I went through journalism school.

Ronnie Robbins 00:07:42

Now, journalism school would have been at that time, and I was at a major university.

Ronnie Robbins 00:07:49

So at that time, we would have been trained to work on daily newspaper print journalism.

Ronnie Robbins 00:07:56

And so much has changed now.

Ronnie Robbins 00:08:00

I think 2008, I started seeing it even more so than before.

Ronnie Robbins 00:08:05

Everything was online and everything was different, and there was so much more you had to learn about journalism, about how journalism was evolving.

Ronnie Robbins 00:08:15

So I had to evolve with journalism as it turned more to online reporting.

Ronnie Robbins 00:08:22

And so those journalists that are trained today are trained digitally.

Ronnie Robbins 00:08:27

They are trained digitally.

Ronnie Robbins 00:08:28

They're not trained to write for a print newspaper that you got and received at your home.

Ronnie Robbins 00:08:35

And so much attention has gone online and since the pandemic, even more so, you know.

Ronnie Robbins 00:08:41

And so I've been able to weather the storms that have come to journalism in general, and everyone being online claiming to be a journalist or claiming to be a writer and vying for your attention, you know, as podcasters do, as, as authors do, as everyone does.

Ronnie Robbins 00:09:01

I'm presently working for a newspaper, a daily newspaper, the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

Ronnie Robbins 00:09:09

I am a Freelancer.

Ronnie Robbins 00:09:11

And I am also freelancing for a major global, all online publication, which is Medscape, which is sister of WebMD.

Ronnie Robbins 00:09:21

And the WebMD office is who used to pay me and now they pay me.

Ronnie Robbins 00:09:27

But I'm a freelancer.

Ronnie Robbins 00:09:29

I was an editor there.

Ronnie Robbins 00:09:30

So I am the real deal in terms of having gone through the changes from print to online.

Ronnie Robbins 00:09:38

So what has changed?

Ronnie Robbins 00:09:40

Everyone is out there being a journalist.

Ronnie Robbins 00:09:42

Everyone is out there vying for your attention, claiming to have the news, giving you the news with their own leanings, perhaps, you know, their own perspective.

Ronnie Robbins 00:09:56

Unbiased journalism, you know, I hope it's still how journalists are being trained.

Ronnie Robbins 00:10:03

So I would definitely look into the background of whoever you're getting your journalism from, whoever you're getting the news from, because we were trained to be unbiased and keep your biases out of the news.

Ronnie Robbins 00:10:19

And I strongly hold on to those ethics.

Ronnie Robbins 00:10:23

I cannot tell you who else does whatever, so that's what you'll get from me and those that were trained to like me back in whenever that was the 80s, the 90s and previous to everything going online again, there's journalism school students coming out.

Ronnie Robbins 00:10:48

Hopefully they're being trained the same way to avoid what's now known as fake news.

Ronnie Robbins 00:10:56

Everyone will label it fake news no matter what I think.

Jessie Hirsch 00:11:00

Well, and there's two kind of key takeaways from that.

Jessie Hirsch 00:11:03

One, that we shifted from gainful employment to precarity, right?

Jessie Hirsch 00:11:09

Where people would have jobs to.

Jessie Hirsch 00:11:11

Most people have to be freelancers now, right?

Jessie Hirsch 00:11:14

So they have to hustle to try to get that work.

Jessie Hirsch 00:11:17

And then to your second point, that I think your ethics is sadly becoming the minority, right.

Jessie Hirsch 00:11:25

That it is almost not yet a scarce ethics, but a diminishing, retreating ethics, which another episode, another time, we would talk about how to change that, right?

Jessie Hirsch 00:11:40

How to bring that ethics back.

Jessie Hirsch 00:11:41

But I want to talk about your book and in particular I want to talk about your book because your point about the loss of objectivity.

Jessie Hirsch 00:11:52

I kind of feel good about subjective stories like this and the way in which it allows, in your case, a family story to become more than that for other people who are not necessarily in your family.

Jessie Hirsch 00:12:08

And for me, the word grandfather is zeta.

Jessie Hirsch 00:12:13

I called my grandfather zeta.

Jessie Hirsch 00:12:15

And I tend to refer even to my gentile or non Jewish friends.

Jessie Hirsch 00:12:19

I tend to refer to their grandfathers as their zeta because I like to normalize my culture.

Jessie Hirsch 00:12:28

You're zeta.

Jessie Hirsch 00:12:31

What was it about his story that inspired you to write this?

Jessie Hirsch 00:12:35

And I don't want to get too much into his story.

Jessie Hirsch 00:12:38

Because I want people to buy your book.

Jessie Hirsch 00:12:39

I want people to really experience it in what I think is the intimacy of reading a book, because you experience it in a much different way than you would a podcast or a TikTok or a video.

Jessie Hirsch 00:12:51

But I'm curious, on an inspiration level, what was it about your Zeta that motivated you to do this?

Ronnie Robbins 00:12:58

So it started with, literally, the romance of his life, the fact that he died on the same date, a year apart from my grandmother.

Ronnie Robbins 00:13:13

The date is coming up January 31st, but I don't know when this podcast will release.

Ronnie Robbins 00:13:18

But to have that kind of a romance, that you die a year apart from each other, that anniversary is so powerful.

Ronnie Robbins 00:13:26

That was the first literal spark that it seemed very special to me, very loving, very romantic.

Ronnie Robbins 00:13:34

So there was that.

Ronnie Robbins 00:13:35

They were married 65 years, but they had to endure sickness and health.

Ronnie Robbins 00:13:41

He was told he was terminal with tuberculosis at 26, and he lived till 86.

Ronnie Robbins 00:13:48

But the way he did that was he was a test case, a clinical trial patient for streptomycin, which is still used today.

Ronnie Robbins 00:13:56

And people think that Covid is the largest infectious disease killer in the world.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:02

Cause we're going through it.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:03

Cause we went through it.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:04

But tuberculosis is still the largest infectious disease killer in the world.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:10

And his experience and his work with testing out that experimental treatment at the time paved the way for medicines that are used today.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:20

And streptomycin is still used today, although there's better treatments, too.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:25

So it was a game changer at that time.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:28

So he was making history.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:29

He also was involved in a workplace shooting spree in which he saved people from a gunman.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:35

He actually talked to the gunman, talked the gunman down.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:39

So there was.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:40

And this was recorded in history.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:42

So a lot of my stories within the larger hands of gold is based on real facts.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:49

Plus, they lost all their family in the Holocaust.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:52

And just experiencing life, my grandmother had to be the breadwinner of five children.

Ronnie Robbins 00:14:59

What is all that like in a.

Ronnie Robbins 00:15:01

In a lifetime to.

Ronnie Robbins 00:15:03

To go through that all together?

Ronnie Robbins 00:15:05

And, you know, we say sickness and health and, you know, good times and bad, but this.

Ronnie Robbins 00:15:10

They experienced all of that.

Ronnie Robbins 00:15:12

Maybe we all do.

Ronnie Robbins 00:15:13

So it can be every man's.

Ronnie Robbins 00:15:16

Every person's story, every person's ethnic journey from Europe or wherever they came from to America.

Ronnie Robbins 00:15:24

So I think that a lot of people can relate to it.

Ronnie Robbins 00:15:27

It's universal.

Jessie Hirsch 00:15:28

Well, and it's incredibly inspirational to your point about the kind of.

Jessie Hirsch 00:15:34

For lack of a better word, the ethic of survival that your family had.

Jessie Hirsch 00:15:40

And as Jews The Holocaust, obviously, is a part of our kind of culture.

Jessie Hirsch 00:15:45

It's a part of how the generations after have really grown up.

Jessie Hirsch 00:15:51

Do you think that his obviously traumatic experience, but at the same time his resilient experience as a survivor, do you think that then influenced the empathy, the compassion, the.

Jessie Hirsch 00:16:04

The connection with the world?

Jessie Hirsch 00:16:06

Your point about him talking down the shooter is, on the one hand, it's kind of Jewish, that our secret weapon is our ability to speak and our ability to reason with people.

Jessie Hirsch 00:16:18

But it's a lot of courage.

Jessie Hirsch 00:16:22

Do you think there's a correlation from that?

Jessie Hirsch 00:16:24

That he survived this incredibly traumatic event and yet it seemed to give him a kind of resilience, a kind of, again, for lack of a better word, capacity to survive.

Jessie Hirsch 00:16:38

That is truly inspiring.

Ronnie Robbins 00:16:42

I think we all have the capacity to survive.

Ronnie Robbins 00:16:46

Maybe not what they had to endure back then.

Ronnie Robbins 00:16:50

So we should be very appreciative if we have good health or if we do, you know, haven't experienced that kind of trauma of losing family to.

Ronnie Robbins 00:17:03

In major tragedies.

Ronnie Robbins 00:17:06

But we think it's back then, but it's now.

Ronnie Robbins 00:17:10

What's happening in Israel, what's happening in Russia, Ukraine, what's happening elsewhere around.

Ronnie Robbins 00:17:17

Those are just two examples of what's.

Jessie Hirsch 00:17:20

Happening in Los Angeles, for example.

Jessie Hirsch 00:17:22

Right, right, right.

Jessie Hirsch 00:17:24

You know, we'll put this episode out probably today.

Jessie Hirsch 00:17:27

And the fires in la, they're saying now it may burn for a month.

Jessie Hirsch 00:17:34

And you're right, there are all these really scary conflicts going around all the world in which survival is literally the ultimate thing you're doing every day.

Ronnie Robbins 00:17:42

Absolutely.

Jessie Hirsch 00:17:43

But we should also remember here in North America, like the Hurricane Helene and it really hit North Carolina and eastern Tennessee, and, you know, even we're taking for granted how survival is becoming, and I don't want to fetishize it, something that we need to be thinking about as a community, that we need to be thinking about as families.

Jessie Hirsch 00:18:05

So I'm curious, you know, in terms of the way in which your grandfather's story, the way in which this book, I think, inspires people, and you were just getting into it, so I kind of want you to elaborate to what extent is survival not just an individual act, but something that we do with our family, that we do with our community, that we do with the people we live in, because I almost feel that we've forgotten that in our kind of North American individualist culture, especially if you look at the kind of nuclear family, as the size of our families have kind of gotten smaller and smaller.

Jessie Hirsch 00:18:46

And that also makes survival a little Difficult.

Jessie Hirsch 00:18:50

So I'm curious to hear your thoughts on that, on aspects of your family story that you think give people the kind of lessons, as you were saying, for where we find ourselves right now.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:02

Well, you bring up some interesting topics.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:05

And I actually have to tell you that I have family in Asheville, North Carolina that survived the, the.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:13

The major storms, the flooding.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:15

They were fine.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:16

They were elevated.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:17

They had to boil their water for a long time.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:21

They, you know, they.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:23

So they had a lack of, you know, electricity and water.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:26

Water was probably the biggest issue.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:29

I have a son in Los Angeles.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:31

I mentioned that he did my TikTok.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:33

He is in.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:34

He is an actor.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:35

He is in the entertainment world.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:38

That whole entertainment world has gone through so much in the past.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:43

They.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:43

We had Covid, okay, that was a blip now then they had the.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:49

They had all the strikes.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:51

Right, Right.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:52

So he's been hit several times.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:55

Maybe this is my hands of gold.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:57

This is my experience.

Ronnie Robbins 00:19:58

You know, this is bringing it back to reality.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:01

I don't know why my family has to get hit in all directions, but I'm doomed to be a survivor too.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:08

I don't know.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:09

My family is doomed to be.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:10

To have to go through things.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:12

But we've, you know, people lost in Covid.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:16

People lost family members and, you know, so it's one big struggle after another to get through whatever it is.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:25

And we have the capacity to endure.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:28

You know, my mom is 81 and we're going to be 81 and she had to go through these flood situation in Asheville, North Carolina.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:39

And her attitude is, what is your choice?

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:42

What is your what, what are you going to do?

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:44

You know, what, what is your option?

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:46

You have to survive.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:48

So it's constant.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:51

You never know when it's going to hit you.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:53

You got to be prepared.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:55

My grandfather in that generation was prepared.

Ronnie Robbins 00:20:58

They went through wars, they had the holocaust.

Ronnie Robbins 00:21:04

Our holocaust is going.

Ronnie Robbins 00:21:06

Israel has been going through a mini holocaust.

Ronnie Robbins 00:21:10

Life repeats itself, history repeats itself.

Ronnie Robbins 00:21:15

But you still have to live your life.

Ronnie Robbins 00:21:17

You have to be positive.

Ronnie Robbins 00:21:19

Because what is your option?

Ronnie Robbins 00:21:20

What is the alternative?

Jessie Hirsch 00:21:22

And let me take something you said there and kind of flip it around.

Jessie Hirsch 00:21:26

Do you have a kind of, for lack of a better phrase, survival strategy?

Jessie Hirsch 00:21:31

And I say this in the abstract in that clearly continuing to practice journalism is a form of survival strategy.

Jessie Hirsch 00:21:38

Right?

Jessie Hirsch 00:21:39

Because you're keeping your brain active, you're keeping your skills active, you're still practicing your ethics in terms of it, it may be in a minority position, but it's, I think, a mitzvah to do that kind of work.

Jessie Hirsch 00:21:55

Beyond that, how do you maintain, in spite of all these troubles, in spite of all these challenges, in spite of all these crises, how do you maintain that attitude?

Jessie Hirsch 00:22:08

Perhaps it's pointing to your Zeta, but what is your strategy when it comes to surviving what may be a turbulent future?

Ronnie Robbins 00:22:19

I don't know about as far as environmental, because we've been talking about environmental.

Ronnie Robbins 00:22:26

How do you survive?

Ronnie Robbins 00:22:27

How do you weather the storm?

Ronnie Robbins 00:22:29

So it took me some more than a decade to get a professional publisher, a traditional publisher for my novel.

Ronnie Robbins 00:22:38

On a smaller scale, I lost my journalism job because we didn't talk about that.

Ronnie Robbins 00:22:43

But there's been a lot of downsizing because of all the competition.

Ronnie Robbins 00:22:49

Downsizing is a big issue for journalism.

Ronnie Robbins 00:22:52

So, yes, there are a lot of people online freelancing, and there's competition for that, but I've managed to keep my hand in it.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:02

I kept my hand in it all throughout when I was writing my book.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:06

I never gave up on a dream.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:09

Is that the motivation?

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:10

Is that what keeps us going is get through, to be able to do what we want to do yet again.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:17

Our passion for life, what it is we're here for, our goal, whatever it is.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:23

My grandfather's goal was to provide a nice life for his family in America and escape what was going on or his limitations in Europe that he saw for himself.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:35

That wasn't always antisemitism.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:38

It was just.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:39

He was going to be a farmer and he wanted something better.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:42

That golden Medina, if you know that term, the.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:46

The golden land, the paradise that they thought existed in America.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:52

And in some ways it does compared to other countries.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:56

How good we have it here.

Ronnie Robbins 00:23:57

So the finish line, the goal, the what's next.

Ronnie Robbins 00:24:02

Survive this, and then what, what, what, you know, what is the next challenge to be met?

Ronnie Robbins 00:24:07

Does that.

Ronnie Robbins 00:24:08

Is that.

Ronnie Robbins 00:24:09

Is that summarizing in.

Ronnie Robbins 00:24:11

In terms of survival?

Ronnie Robbins 00:24:12

Yes, I am a survivor, but I.

Jessie Hirsch 00:24:15

Think that's both a brilliant and beautiful way to frame it.

Jessie Hirsch 00:24:18

And again, in respect to your Zeta, I happen to be personally living one of my dreams, which is to have a farm, a very modest farm here in Canada.

Jessie Hirsch 00:24:28

It's very cold at the moment here in January, but nonetheless, I think that is an absolutely beautiful vision to have.

Jessie Hirsch 00:24:40

Have goals, have desires.

Jessie Hirsch 00:24:42

I often describe it as imagining a future where you're happy, imagining a future where you're active.

Jessie Hirsch 00:24:49

And that's the survival strategy, where you may never get there, the present may never live up to that, but as long as you're pursuing that, it's a phenomenal opportunity.

Jessie Hirsch 00:24:59

And my Other dream, of course, has always been to make media, to make radio, to make television, to talk to smart and interesting people such as yourself.

Jessie Hirsch 00:25:09

Now, our last segment is always shout outs.

Jessie Hirsch 00:25:13

And here's where I'm going to shout out my Bubby and Zeta, my grandparents who left this world quite a long time ago, but they've had a huge impact on me and my desire to tell stories and share stories.

Jessie Hirsch 00:25:27

And that's kind of why I was really interested, Ronnie, in your story.

Jessie Hirsch 00:25:32

Because as I mentioned earlier, I feel that our attention deficit society means that we're losing touch with our past, we're losing touch with history, we're forgetting the people who came before us.

Jessie Hirsch 00:25:45

So I love stories like this.

Jessie Hirsch 00:25:47

I love promoting stories like this.

Jessie Hirsch 00:25:50

So I encourage my readers, my listeners, my viewers at home to check out Hands of Gold.

Jessie Hirsch 00:25:57

But before we sort of give you that last moment to, you know, plug anything beyond your website, do you have anyone you want to shout out to that you want to send good words to?

Jessie Hirsch 00:26:09

You kind of indirectly already shouted out your son a couple of times, which is pretty cool.

Jessie Hirsch 00:26:14

Anyone else you want to let them know that you're thinking about them?

Ronnie Robbins 00:26:18

Well, my mom, she's about to be 81 and she's the one who passed me the cassette tapes that my grandfather left the family about his adventures and near death experience experiences in Europe and America.

Ronnie Robbins 00:26:31

And she, I don't think she intended or knew that I would create a novel for it, but I don't think she's totally surprised by it either.

Ronnie Robbins 00:26:39

I think she knew I might, you know, I would appreciate the story and, and I was a writer and, and that maybe I would do something with it, of course, my grandfather for leaving the cassette tapes and.

Ronnie Robbins 00:26:50

But they got into my hands, my golden hands.

Ronnie Robbins 00:26:54

And I think that was smart, actually, that they did because they might have just been cassette tapes that got destroyed someplace.

Ronnie Robbins 00:27:03

Instead, they became a beautiful story that I can share with the world.

Ronnie Robbins 00:27:08

So his legacy lives on and I think he's worthy of that.

Ronnie Robbins 00:27:13

And both my grandparents, but my mom, because she has such a beautiful attitude about life and maybe she got that from her father and she's the matriarch of the family and she deserves that title because she's the one that's continuing, continuing to lead in a Jewish way and as the, as the Jewish matriarch of our family, she's the one who started it all in terms of passing on the Jewish culture and the strong faith that my grandfather had.

Ronnie Robbins 00:27:47

So she is the one that's doing that for the entire family, I think, and I think everyone would agree about that.

Ronnie Robbins 00:27:54

And hopefully I'm doing that for my family.

Ronnie Robbins 00:27:56

Family in some way because so many are losing that.

Ronnie Robbins 00:28:01

And it really is a, a beautiful faith system and of strong values and, and being good to people.

Ronnie Robbins 00:28:11

Those, those kind of ethical values are important to pass on.

Jessie Hirsch 00:28:17

Right on.

Jessie Hirsch 00:28:18

Right on.

Jessie Hirsch 00:28:19

Thank you very much, Ronnie.

Jessie Hirsch 00:28:21

I think this has been really quite a fascinating discussion.

Jessie Hirsch 00:28:26

Jessie Hirsch 00:28:31

Let me pull your website back up here again.

Jessie Hirsch 00:28:34

Is there anywhere else that people could.

Jessie Hirsch 00:28:36

Should connect with you?

Jessie Hirsch 00:28:37

Any social platforms that you prefer?

Ronnie Robbins 00:28:41

I'm, I'm on Facebook.

Ronnie Robbins 00:28:43

I've got several Facebooks.

Ronnie Robbins 00:28:44

Ronnie Robbins, Ronnie Kane Robbins, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, X.

Ronnie Robbins 00:28:51

So hopefully people can find me just by Googling my name.

Jessie Hirsch 00:28:58

Right on.

Ronnie Robbins 00:29:01

Where the book is located and elsewhere.

Jessie Hirsch 00:29:05

Right on.

Jessie Hirsch 00:29:06

Very cool.

Jessie Hirsch 00:29:07

All right, thank you very much, Ronnie.

Jessie Hirsch 00:29:09

This has been another excellent episode of Meta Views.

Jessie Hirsch 00:29:13

We love to talk to people who have interesting ideas, interesting books, interesting concepts.

Jessie Hirsch 00:29:20

Please get in touch and if your grandparents are alive, give them a call.

Jessie Hirsch 00:29:27

Go visit them, go spend some time with them if they're not alive, tell their story.

Jessie Hirsch 00:29:33

Let people know about the impact that they had on the world because we need that sort of thing.

Jessie Hirsch 00:29:39

We need more respect for our elders and we need to understand the wisdom that they've left for us.

Jessie Hirsch 00:29:45

So it's Jesse Hirsch saying goodbye and we'll see you soon.
