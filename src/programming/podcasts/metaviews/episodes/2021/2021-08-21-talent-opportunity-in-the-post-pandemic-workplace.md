The pandemic has transformed work and learning, and this will be 

particularly evident as we emerge into a post-pandemic world. One 

person’s disruption is another person’s opportunity. Similarly some 

organizations have responded with incredible resilience, and are 

experiencing unprecedented growth and success.

Historically great crises and catastrophes are followed by renaissances 

and periods of incredible innovation. What’s the difference between 

success and failure, between depression and excitement? Talent. This is 

true for both individuals and organizations.

  

How do you foster and harness your talent? How do organizations attract,

 develop, and retain talent? These are crucial questions during this 

transitional period as we remain in a pandemic but seek our path out of 

it!
