As a futurist and social designer, Andriana Lagoudes builds inclusive systems for sidelined people to unlearn their shame. Andriana does this by navigating and researching through complex political problems to design new code based on people’s best case scenario.

In this episode of Metaviews, Andriana joins host Jesse Hirsh to talk about the politics of the future, the politics of care, and why we're living in a moment where ethics may be more important than aesthetics.
