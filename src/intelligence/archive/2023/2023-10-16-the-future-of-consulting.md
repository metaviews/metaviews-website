Similarly artificial intelligence is causing firms and individuals to question how they work and what they do.</p><p name="c1d7" id="c1d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the consulting industry dives deep into these trends, it provides a moment to reflect on what it means to be a consultant, and more importantly what the future of consulting is.</p><p name="1139" id="1139" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a profession, consultants are incredibly diverse, and consulting firms come in all shapes and sizes. Yet what consultants have in common is the professional focus on adapting, learning, and leveraging the opportunities that are available. Consultants should be ahead of the pack, offering guidance, and helping others achieve their goals and dreams.</p><p name="b971" id="b971" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is why we offer our vision of the future of consulting, embodied by the 5 Cs:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="1ba3" id="1ba3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Conversation</strong>. True, honest and heartfelt dialogue. No more one way, top down corporate communication, advice and consulting.</li><li name="901b" id="901b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Collaboration</strong>. Goals are articulated, pursued and achieved as a team, in a true partnership, power with, not power over.</li><li name="d82e" id="d82e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Cooperation</strong>. Acknowledging the strengths and competencies as well as the weaknesses and dysfunctions of others, with respect and empathy. This enables an additive process that benefits all and encourages mutual learning and mentoring.</li><li name="46cf" id="46cf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Continuity</strong>. Today’s markets and societies are remarkably elastic and too fast for consultants to be here today and gone tomorrow. Success is achieved and maintained through ongoing engagement and monitoring in order to be able to act promptly if the situation requires it.</li><li name="9ead" id="9ead" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Compassion</strong>. We all come from different places and have difficult struggles that should engender a compassion for each other and the world around us. Consultants were once associated with cutthroat tactics, but if we are to respond to the crises we face, compassion needs to be the guiding principle for all consulting work.</li></ol><p name="8a82" id="8a82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">What do you think?</p></div></div></section>
