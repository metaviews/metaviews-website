I’m particularly interested in those that demonstrate some form of personalization.</p><figure name="4e20" id="4e20" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/nickcharney/status/1641542803795615744"></a></blockquote></figure><p name="e981" id="e981" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I found Nick’s exercise interesting and decided to try it out myself.</p><p name="dd8a" id="dd8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Although before asking the machine to write for me, I first asked it to tell me who I am. The answer was close, but far from accurate. As many others have noted, ChatGPT is great for bullshit, but not precision.</p><p name="3aa4" id="3aa4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first piece of writing I commissioned was a manifesto that I might write. The result, which I’m not going to share, was kind of basic, banal, even binary, but not too far from the mark.</p><p name="86e4" id="86e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The second piece of writing, which I share below, was similar not great, but not bad. If I were to give it a quick human pass, and change some of the words, it’d be perfectly suitable.</p><p name="53a1" id="53a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re undoubtedly going to see a tsunami of content over the next several months. What rises and what falls is partly what’s at stake with TikTok vs US Government.</p><p name="66d5" id="66d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet I also foresee another agenda at work here, which is the internal logic of systems like ChatGPT. What’s curious about the post I include below, is not just that it could be written by me, but that it is a logic I can imagine the machine supporting, rather than myself.</p><p name="fc4f" id="fc4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a weird political twist in the words that is subtle, but worth teasing out further.</p><p name="5b03" id="5b03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s a great tune to help with that reflection (post appended below):</p><figure name="57eb" id="57eb" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KvOoR8m0oms?feature=oembed" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="b1e7" id="b1e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">The Power of Digital Sovereignty: Why We Need to Reclaim Control of Our Online Lives</strong></p><p name="db86" id="db86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The digital age has brought about incredible advances in technology and communication, but it has also come with a significant cost: the loss of digital sovereignty. We have allowed ourselves to become dependent on large corporations and governments for our online existence, and this has led to a loss of control over our data, our privacy, and our digital identities.</p><p name="6e6d" id="6e6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we continue to rely more and more on digital technologies, we need to start thinking about how we can reclaim control over our digital lives. We need to demand more transparency and accountability from the companies that control our data, and we need to advocate for policies that prioritize digital sovereignty.</p><p name="db03" id="db03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Digital sovereignty means having control over our data and our online presence. It means being able to decide how our data is used, who has access to it, and for what purposes. It means being able to communicate freely and securely, without fear of government surveillance or censorship. It means having the power to shape our digital identities and our online communities.</p><p name="8cbf" id="8cbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To achieve digital sovereignty, we need to start by taking control of our data. We need to be aware of the information we are sharing online and who we are sharing it with. We need to use tools that protect our privacy, like encryption and virtual private networks. We need to demand more transparency and accountability from the companies that control our data, and we need to support policies that prioritize user privacy and data protection.</p><p name="eeb5" id="eeb5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We also need to support alternative, decentralized digital platforms that prioritize user control and ownership. Platforms like Mastodon, PeerTube, and Matrix are decentralized and user-owned, meaning that users have more control over their data and their online communities. By supporting these platforms, we can help build a more decentralized and democratic digital ecosystem.</p><p name="9581" id="9581" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, we need to advocate for policies that prioritize digital sovereignty and user rights. This means pushing for regulations that protect user privacy and data, and that limit the power of corporations and governments to control our online lives. It means supporting initiatives that promote digital literacy and education, so that users are empowered to make informed decisions about their online presence.</p><p name="64c6" id="64c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In short, we need to start thinking about digital sovereignty as a fundamental human right. We need to reclaim control over our digital lives and demand more transparency, accountability, and user ownership. Only then can we create a more just and democratic digital future for all.</p></div></div></section>
