There was no single moment that signaled collapse. Instead, there was a brief surge of violence, followed by an eerie calm. The leader was gone. The state remained.</p><p>We are trained to see coups as spectacle: uniforms, proclamations, ruptures. What happened in Venezuela confounds that expectation. And because it confounds it, many observers instinctively reach for reassurance. This wasn’t a coup, they say. It was a targeted operation. A law enforcement action. A security intervention. Something else.</p><p>But authority was removed. And that is the only definition that matters.</p><p>What unfolded in Venezuela was not a failure of power, but a demonstration of a new way it operates.</p><p>The president was extracted through a combination of <a href="http://reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/mock-house-cia-source-special-forces-us-operation-capture-maduro-2026-01-03/">intelligence penetration</a>, selective violence, and speed. Resistance was limited. State institutions did not implode. A successor narrative emerged almost immediately. Ministries continued to function. The legal debate followed later, once the facts were already settled.</p><p>This was not chaos. It was managed discontinuity.</p><p>To understand why this matters, we need to abandon the outdated idea that authority lives primarily in visible institutions. In the twentieth century, seizing power meant occupying territory, controlling broadcasting, arresting rivals, and declaring sovereignty by force. Authority and the state were tightly coupled.</p><p>They no longer are.</p><p>Today, authority is distributed across systems that precede politics: intelligence alignment, financial rails, communications infrastructure, diplomatic recognition, compliance regimes, and procedural legitimacy. Control those, and leadership becomes modular. Removable. Replaceable.</p><p>This is what hybrid war looks like when it matures.</p><p>Hybrid war is often described as a blend of military, informational, economic, and political tactics. That definition undersells it. What matters is not the mix of tools, but the sequencing. Violence is no longer the opening move. It is the accelerant applied once administrative dominance is already in place.</p><p>In Venezuela, the kinetic moment was brief and decisive, not because the regime collapsed, but because parts of it didn’t resist. That silence is not evidence of surprise. It is evidence of fragmentation.</p><p>There does not need to be a negotiated settlement with “the regime” for negotiation to occur. In modern authority removal, negotiation happens at the level of individuals and factions. Commanders calculate survival. Economic managers hedge their exposure. Security officials choose inaction over martyrdom. Silence becomes a bargain. Non-interference becomes consent.</p><p>These are not treaties. They leave no paper trail. They are deniable by design.</p><p>This is why the question “was it negotiated?” is both essential and misleading. The more accurate question is: <em>which parts of the system aligned early enough to make resistance futile?</em></p><p>What follows after the extraction matters even more than the extraction itself. The objective is not to destroy the state, but to preserve it under new constraints. Authority is not seized; it is updated. Leadership is removed, systems are stabilized, and legitimacy is engineered after the fact.</p><p>This is where much of our earlier work becomes unavoidable.</p><p>In past issues, we’ve argued that <strong>algorithmic authority</strong> is not about artificial intelligence making decisions, but about procedural systems deciding <em>what decisions are even available</em>. Venezuela is not an AI story, but it is an algorithmic one. Authority was exercised through speed, coordination, and system-level alignment that outpaced public deliberation.</p><p>We’ve also warned about <strong>soft annexation</strong>: the erosion of sovereignty not through occupation, but through integration so deep that refusal becomes structurally impossible. Venezuela represents the kinetic edge of that phenomenon. No territory was annexed, but autonomy was overridden. The node was removed. The network remained.</p><p>This is the same logic behind what we’ve called <strong>forced consensus</strong>. Hybrid operations do not require public agreement. They only require that dissent becomes operationally irrelevant. If everyday life continues—banks clear payments, communications function, services remain available—stability itself becomes the argument. Continuity substitutes for consent.</p><p>The legality debate, then, is not meaningless, but it is late. International law is no longer a gatekeeper; it is a secondary battlefield. By the time lawyers argue over authorization, self-defense, or precedent, authority has already relocated. The order of operations has flipped: action first, stabilization second, narrative third, legality last.</p><p>Which brings us to Canada.</p><p>For years, Canada has treated deep integration with the United States as synonymous with security. Shared intelligence, shared defense command structures, shared data regimes, shared economic rails—these are presented as neutral, technical, cooperative arrangements. They are also the conditions that make authority legible, interoperable, and therefore bypassable.</p><p>Canada does not need to be invaded to be overridden.</p><p>Our vulnerability is not military weakness, but administrative compatibility. Our institutions are stable, predictable, and deeply embedded in transnational systems that operate faster than democratic processes. If authority were ever removed here, it would not look dramatic. Parliament would still sit. Courts would still function. Elections would still be scheduled. The language would be continuity, not rupture.</p><p>And that is precisely why it would be so hard to recognize.</p><p>Venezuela should be read less as a foreign policy anomaly and more as a proof of concept. A demonstration of how authority can be extracted cleanly, quietly, and professionally, without triggering the reflexes we associate with democratic breakdown.</p><p>The danger is not that coups are returning.</p><p>The danger is that they no longer announce themselves.</p><p>Authority can now be removed with minimal spectacle, without consensus, and without the visible collapse that once made resistance possible. And unless we update our political literacy to match this reality, we will keep mistaking administration for stability, and continuity for consent.</p><p>The future of coups isn’t violence. It’s governance.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cpscott15%2Fvideo%2F7591268307173510431&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@cpscott15/video/7591268307173510431&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Maduro may have been betrayed. #venezuela #trump #maduro #coup #war &quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/264-the-coup-without-a-coup/8af0ef4a-740a-41a5-a0f3-4e2c39d7c64a_1080x1920-66578438.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Chad Scott&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cpscott15%2Fvideo%2F7591268307173510431&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@cpscott15&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cpscott15%2Fvideo%2F7591268307173510431&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cpscott15%2Fvideo%2F7591268307173510431&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cpscott15%2Fvideo%2F7591268307173510431&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cpscott15/video/7591268307173510431" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/264-the-coup-without-a-coup/8af0ef4a-740a-41a5-a0f3-4e2c39d7c64a_1080x1920-66578438.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sNAW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8af0ef4a-740a-41a5-a0f3-4e2c39d7c64a_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cpscott15" target="_blank">@cpscott15</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cpscott15/video/7591268307173510431" target="_blank">Maduro may have been betrayed. #venezuela #trump #maduro #coup #war </a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cpscott15%2Fvideo%2F7591268307173510431&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/264-the-coup-without-a-coup/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
