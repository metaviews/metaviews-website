It is the signal.</p><p>The public story is tidy and familiar: melting ice, rare earth minerals, Arctic shipping lanes, Russian submarines, Chinese investment, American bases. Greenland appears as the next square on a geopolitical chessboard, valuable because of where it sits and what lies beneath it.</p><p>But that story doesn’t explain the intensity of interest, nor its strange ideological charge. What is emerging around Greenland is not simply a dispute over territory. It is a struggle over <strong>what the state is allowed to be</strong>, and over who gets to decide when sovereignty no longer applies.</p><p>At the centre of the web tying these threads together sits <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>.</p><p>Thiel is often miscast as a hidden puppeteer. That framing is too dramatic and too shallow. His real influence is not operational control but intellectual gravity and mobilized wealth. For years, he has argued that democracy is an obstacle to freedom, that the nation-state is an exhausted form, and that legitimacy should be earned through performance rather than consent. These ideas once lived on the margins of political discourse. Today, they circulate comfortably through venture capital, defense-adjacent technology, post-democratic theory, and increasingly, the institutions of the U.S. state itself.</p><p>Greenland is where those currents begin to converge in physical space.</p><p>Through Thiel-backed investment networks and aligned ideological circles, sovereignty has been treated less as a moral boundary than as a design problem. Seasteading, charter cities, special jurisdictions, and now network states all express the same underlying belief: the state is not sacred, only provisional. It exists only so long as it delivers outcomes aligned with capital, coordination, and control.</p><p>The network state concept, articulated most explicitly by <strong>Balaji Srinivasan</strong>, proposes a simple inversion with radical consequences. Legitimacy comes first; territory follows later. Governance becomes a service. Citizenship becomes optional. Exit replaces accountability. Democracy is reframed as inefficiency. This worldview does not seek to overthrow states. It seeks to make them <strong>irrelevant</strong>.</p><p>That is where Greenland comes in.</p><p>When <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-freedom-city-rich-donors-push-trump-tech-hub-up-north-2025-04-10/">Praxis</a></strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-freedom-city-rich-donors-push-trump-tech-hub-up-north-2025-04-10/"> speaks openly about Greenland as a possible site for experimentation</a>, the provocation is not naïve ambition. It is ideological coherence. Greenland is imagined as sparsely populated, strategically indispensable, resource-rich, and politically liminal. In other words, a place where sovereignty can be quietly reframed as underperformance, and self-determination as underutilization.</p><p>This is the frontier logic reborn, not with settlers and flags, but with pitch decks, governance frameworks, and venture capital timelines.</p><p>What makes the moment dangerous is not that these ideas exist, but that they are no longer confined to speculative startups or online manifestos. They have begun to merge with state power itself. The appointment of <strong>Ken Howery</strong> as US ambassador to Denmark makes that convergence impossible to ignore. A longtime Thiel associate and PayPal co-founder now occupies the diplomatic hinge between the United States, Denmark, and Greenland.</p><p>Howery’s significance is not personal intent. It is structural symbolism. Silicon Valley’s post-state imagination has moved from critique, to experiment, to <strong>integration</strong>. The language has shifted from disruption to security, from exit to alignment, but the underlying assumptions remain intact.</p><p>Greenland is where this fusion becomes visible.</p><p>What is being tested there is not whether Greenland can be bought, annexed, or developed. The test is subtler and more consequential. Can sovereignty be bent without breaking? Can consent be sidelined by urgency? Can Indigenous authority be acknowledged rhetorically while overridden materially? Can legitimacy be redefined without ever naming the redefinition?</p><p>If the answer is yes, even partially, precedent is established. Not in law, but in expectation. And expectation is how authority changes without announcement.</p><p>This external experimentation mirrors an internal transformation within the United States. Legitimacy is quietly shifting from democratic consent to performance metrics. Politics is being displaced by management. Citizenship is being thinned into access. The state is increasingly imagined not as the expression of a people, but as a coordination platform.</p><p>Greenland is useful precisely because it allows this transformation to be rehearsed elsewhere, beyond constitutional limits and domestic resistance. What looks like foreign policy is, in reality, ideological dry-running.</p><p>Canada is not a bystander to this process. It is structurally caught in the middle.</p><p>Canada shares the Arctic geography, the resource base, and the security entanglement, but lacks the clarity of refusal Greenland has shown. Canadian sovereignty has long been exercised through accommodation and alignment with American power. That strategy becomes fragile in a world where sovereignty itself is conditional.</p><p>If authority can be redefined in Greenland as something earned through optimization, alignment, or usefulness, then Canada’s own claims become vulnerable to the same logic. Not through invasion, but through normalization. Normalization of exceptions. Normalization of extraterritorial demands. Normalization of private governance stitched quietly into public authority.</p><p>Greenland is not the endgame. It is the signal flare.</p><p>It tells us the struggle ahead is not between nations, but between models of authority: one rooted in people, place, and consent; the other in capital, coordination, and control. Peter Thiel did not invent this struggle, but his ideas, networks, and investments have given it coherence and momentum.</p><p>Canada is close enough to see it clearly. While we can align ourselves with NATO and defend the territorial sovereignty of Greenland, we can also attest to how our own sovereignty has been systemically compromised by wealth, capital, and the whims of Empire.</p><p>The only remaining question is whether it will respond in advance, or adapt only once adaptation is no longer optional.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40raebaebae28%2Fvideo%2F7595427621832330551&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@raebaebae28/video/7595427621832330551&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;MN&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/271-will-greenland-be-thiels-moment/977f85e9-fbc1-4bb5-9cd8-6566fa865b17_1080x1920-3eea4c29.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Rae&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40raebaebae28%2Fvideo%2F7595427621832330551&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@raebaebae28&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40raebaebae28%2Fvideo%2F7595427621832330551&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40raebaebae28%2Fvideo%2F7595427621832330551&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40raebaebae28%2Fvideo%2F7595427621832330551&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@raebaebae28/video/7595427621832330551" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/271-will-greenland-be-thiels-moment/977f85e9-fbc1-4bb5-9cd8-6566fa865b17_1080x1920-3eea4c29.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w27X!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F977f85e9-fbc1-4bb5-9cd8-6566fa865b17_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@raebaebae28" target="_blank">@raebaebae28</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@raebaebae28/video/7595427621832330551" target="_blank">MN</a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40raebaebae28%2Fvideo%2F7595427621832330551&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/271-will-greenland-be-thiels-moment/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
