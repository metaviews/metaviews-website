Instead it is a retcon: a retroactive rewrite of recent political history designed not to clarify the past, but to destabilize how the present is understood.</p><p>Retconning works by leaving the facts technically intact while radically altering their meaning. Nothing is erased. Everything is reframed. The past becomes newly legible, but only through a lens chosen by those who benefit from confusion.</p><div class="twitter-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/jessehirsh/status/2018284703611003012&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;The current dominance of conspiracy heuristics has considerable consequences.

It does not resolve unanswered questions about power, abuse, or institutional failure. Instead, it floods the zone with implication. Names appear. Associations proliferate. The archive expands faster than interpretation can keep up. What emerges is not accountability, but a sense that everything is connected to everything else, and therefore nothing can be acted upon with confidence.</p><p>This is a sophisticated move by an administration currently engaged in the slow, procedural work of undermining the integrity of the 2026 elections. Electoral rigging is boring. It happens through committees, court rulings, regulatory capture, and administrative drift. It requires sustained attention and institutional literacy. The Epstein files, by contrast, offer spectacle. They offer scandal without resolution. They offer a story that feels vast enough to explain everything that feels wrong.</p><p>Most importantly, they reinforce conspiracy as the dominant mode of sense-making.</p><p>The files invite the emergence of a meta-conspiracy: not a single hidden plot, but a recursive logic in which any proximity becomes evidence, any association becomes guilt, and any denial becomes further proof. In this frame, power is no longer structural or procedural. It is occult. Politics becomes detective fiction. Citizenship becomes pattern-matching.</p><p>What gets lost is something we already learned decades ago, long before Epstein became a symbol rather than a person: social networks collapse distance. The “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon</a>” problem was popular culture’s way of grappling with the reality that elite, media, and cultural worlds are densely interconnected. In such a system, almost anyone can be linked to anyone else with minimal effort. This is especially true of a well-connected social predator whose survival depended on proximity to wealth and status.</p><p>That does not mean those connections are meaningless. It means they require care, evidence, and proportion. Conspiracy thinking discards all three.</p><p>This is how we arrive at arguments claiming Epstein was responsible for Gamergate because a conversation he once had with Christopher Poole allegedly influenced the creation of /pol/ on 4chan. The claim is absurd. But it is also instructive. It shows how collective responsibility — for misogyny, for harassment culture, for platform design, for political radicalization — is displaced onto a mythic figure. Epstein becomes the explanatory sink into which all uncomfortable questions disappear.</p><p>This displacement serves power. Fascist movements thrive on personalized evil rather than systemic analysis. If everything is caused by monsters, then institutions remain innocent. If corruption is always secret and hidden, then the visible machinery of governance escapes scrutiny. If politics is a puzzle to be solved rather than a system to be contested, participation collapses into spectatorship.</p><p>None of this diminishes the reality of Epstein’s crimes or the suffering of his victims. On the contrary, conspiratorial inflation cheapens that suffering by converting it into narrative fuel. Justice requires specificity. Accountability requires limits. Conspiracy dissolves both.</p><p>What we are watching is not exposure but the enclosure of political imagination within an endless hall of mirrors. The past is being retconned not to reveal how power actually operates, but to ensure that the present feels too incoherent to challenge.</p><p>And while attention is captured by lists, rumors, and speculative graphs, the quieter work continues: electoral rules adjusted, oversight weakened, courts packed, norms hollowed out.</p><p>The danger is not that people will believe the wrong story about Epstein. The danger is that conspiracy becomes the only story people believe can exist, leaving authority unexamined precisely where it is most concrete, procedural, and vulnerable to capture.</p><p>The sabotage and or theft of the 2026 elections may appear as a conspiracy, but it is happening openly, legally, and with insufficient opposition or attention.</p><p>That is the real retcon. The shift from politics as something we can understand and intervene in, to politics as an unknowable plot we can only watch unfold.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40kingadahipsters%2Fvideo%2F7601391364672113933&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@kingadahipsters/video/7601391364672113933&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;there is so much context needed to understand how big of a deal this is &quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/277-kevin-bacon-and-the-great-epstein-retcon/91e83db6-f2ce-409c-b719-4299e6c832fc_1080x1920-98a5f702.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;hey its josh&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40kingadahipsters%2Fvideo%2F7601391364672113933&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@kingadahipsters&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40kingadahipsters%2Fvideo%2F7601391364672113933&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40kingadahipsters%2Fvideo%2F7601391364672113933&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40kingadahipsters%2Fvideo%2F7601391364672113933&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kingadahipsters/video/7601391364672113933" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/277-kevin-bacon-and-the-great-epstein-retcon/91e83db6-f2ce-409c-b719-4299e6c832fc_1080x1920-98a5f702.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8XQC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91e83db6-f2ce-409c-b719-4299e6c832fc_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kingadahipsters" target="_blank">@kingadahipsters</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kingadahipsters/video/7601391364672113933" target="_blank">there is so much context needed to understand how big of a deal this is </a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40kingadahipsters%2Fvideo%2F7601391364672113933&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/277-kevin-bacon-and-the-great-epstein-retcon/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
