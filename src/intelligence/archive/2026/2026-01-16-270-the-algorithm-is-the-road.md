When pressure arrives from Washington, the reflex is to defend what exists instead of asking what could be different.</p><p>That reflex is exactly how we lost the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Canada_CF-105_Arrow">Avro Arrow</a>, not because we lacked talent or ambition, but because we failed to turn a technological breakthrough into a durable ecosystem. Autonomy presents the same fork in the road, with one crucial difference: this time, the system can be participatory by design.</p><h2>The algorithm <em>is</em> the road</h2><p>Autonomy is not a feature you bolt onto a car. It is a coordination layer that governs vehicles, infrastructure, software updates, diagnostics, liability, and learning. Once vehicles become software-defined, safety and prosperity come from <strong>system coherence</strong>, not individual brilliance.</p><p>This system coherence largely comes in the form of communication. Fundamentally that is what the Internet as a system enables, and autonomy is an affordance that depends upon successful communication.</p><p>Presently we’ve relied upon basic communication within transportation systems. Signal lights, paint on the road, or even hand gestures 🖕. Increasingly many of us are also now using navigation apps that include real-time traffic or weather data. Yet these are all tiny fragments of a much larger information ecosystem that exists and is emerging.</p><p>In particular, traffic, like the Internet, is a system where centralized or top down control is near impossible. Instead we can recognize a system that will become more complex and yet also more powerful with increased information.</p><p>That insight changes everything about industrial strategy. Instead of trying to crown a national champion, Canada can build an <strong>open mobility platform</strong>, an autonomous vehicle (AV) commons, where many firms, builders, and communities participate.</p><p>Control comes not from command, but from coordination via the platform. The shared system itself, the road as it were, is what helps enable efficiency and inclusivity.</p><h3>The commons as an on-ramp for entrepreneurs</h3><p>The most underappreciated advantage of an AV commons is that it radically lowers the barrier to entry.</p><p>If the chassis interfaces, drive-by-wire standards, sensor abstractions, and core autonomy stack are open and certified, then <strong>new Canadian companies don’t need to reinvent the car</strong>. They can specialize.</p><p>This is already happening at the margins. <strong><a href="https://www.edisonmotors.ca/">Edison Motors</a></strong> is a useful signal because it shows how much appetite exists for domestic, mission-driven vehicle manufacturing once the barriers come down. Edison’s success points to a latent ecosystem: builders, suppliers, machinists, and customers who want vehicles that are repairable, purpose-built, and locally accountable.</p><p>The commons formalizes that instinct.</p><p>Entrepreneurs can enter at multiple layers:</p><ul><li><p>Vehicle assembly and specialty platforms</p></li><li><p>Autonomy integration and fleet software</p></li><li><p>Sensors, retrofit kits, diagnostics, and maintenance tooling</p></li><li><p>Mapping, routing, and domain-specific autonomy (agriculture, snow, industrial sites)</p></li></ul><p>Instead of a single bet, you get a <strong>portfolio of bets</strong>, all interoperable.</p><p>This only works if the regulations that govern that ecosystem are coherent and clear. Unfortunately this is <a href="https://www.producer.com/crops/gap-in-emission-regulations-hamstrings-canadian-hybrid-truck-manufacturer/">a problem Edison Motors has encountered as their technology outpaced existing regulations</a>.</p><p>Entrepreneurial ecosystems die when regulation is either absent or arbitrary. The solution here is not deregulation, it is <em>clarity and legibility</em>.</p><p>A national autonomous certification framework could address this challenge and offer clarity to market participants by:</p><ul><li><p>Certifying <strong>systems</strong>, not companies</p></li><li><p>Be scoped to operational domains (speed, geography, conditions)</p></li><li><p>Attach liability to certified operators and stacks, not fictional “drivers”</p></li><li><p>Require transparent telemetry and incident reporting</p></li></ul><p>This does two things at once. It gives insurers, regulators, and fleet buyers confidence, while giving startups a <strong>clear target</strong> to build toward. You know what “good” looks like, and you know when you’ve reached it.</p><p>The current problem is that regulators and market actors are at odds, rather than existing within a shared ecosystem where communication and iteration is shared and transparent. We have an adversarial system rather than a co-operative system, in part because we create roadblocks to participation rather than embracing it.</p><p>Regulation is seen as an obstacle, when instead it should be the enabler, an on-ramp to prosperity.</p><h3>Fleets first, but not fleets only</h3><p>Fleets remain the fastest way to scale safely. They concentrate learning, standardize maintenance, and create early demand. But excluding end consumers would be a strategic mistake.</p><p>Public excitement matters. Cultural legitimacy matters. And innovation often comes from the edges.</p><p>That’s where a <strong>DIY and hacker pathway</strong> becomes a strength rather than a risk.</p><p>Open-source autonomy projects already exist, most notably <strong><a href="https://comma.ai/">comma.ai</a></strong> and its widely used <strong><a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">openpilot</a></strong> stack. Instead of treating this culture as a threat, the commons should <strong>absorb it</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Sandbox environments where enthusiasts can test and contribute within defined safety constraints</p></li><li><p>Clear separation between experimental and certified modes</p></li><li><p>Secure update channels that allow community contribution without compromising system integrity</p></li><li><p>Public reference designs that invite learning, tinkering, and improvement</p></li></ul><p>This is how the internet stayed resilient: openness paired with layered security, not prohibition.</p><p>A participatory system builds literacy. Literacy builds trust. Trust builds political durability.</p><p>The auto industry thrives off of after market and garage based innovation and adaptation. Recent trends have seen independent mechanics and car owners locked out of repairing or modifying their vehicle, whereas the health of the industry and ecosystem requires the opposite.</p><p>We don’t need to worry about the right to repair if we’ve already secured the right to build and modify.</p><p>The logic of the Internet is that of a network of networks where connection and interoperability are inherent. Why would we not apply this exact same logic to our transportation systems?</p><h3>Resilience without isolation</h3><p>A U.S. backlash or USMCA challenge is predictable. The defense is architectural.</p><p>If the commons is framed as <strong>public safety and infrastructure</strong>, procurement authority is strong. If foreign manufacturers can participate by meeting open standards, discrimination claims weaken. If Canada aligns its standards with other jurisdictions, isolation becomes impossible.</p><p>Crucially, ownership shifts from factories to <strong>protocols</strong>. Factories can move. Protocols are harder to dislodge.</p><p>Canada’s real enemy is not Washington or Beijing. It is our habit of treating policy as a domain of experts that serve at the whim of politicians. Instead we should treat policy for what it is, a public good that enables public benefit.</p><p>The current reconfiguration of our relationship with the US offers us an opportunity to focus on what we share in common, which is our ability to move around or country.</p><p>The organizations who already already operate at system scale: provinces, major cities, public fleet operators, Indigenous governments, utilities, and transit authorities ostensibly plan for decades. Let’s embrace that view by reconciling our transportation systems and our communication systems.</p><h3>Avoiding another Avro Arrow</h3><p>The Arrow wasn’t cancelled because it was too ambitious. It was cancelled because it was <strong>alone</strong>.</p><p>Autonomy will fail the same way if we chase a flagship instead of building a commons. But if we recognize that the algorithm <em>is</em> the road, and that roads work best when they are public, shared, and continuously maintained, then Canada has a rare chance to get this right.</p><p>Not by outspending others.<br>Not by copying Silicon Valley.<br>But by doing what we quietly do best when we remember how: building infrastructure that lets many people move, safely and prosperously, in the same direction.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40jabaddams%2Fvideo%2F7594911421482192150&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@jabaddams/video/7594911421482192150&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Stop feeding the birds.  It's something I struggle to find myself saying as I've fed the birds almost all of my life. However, over the last couple of years, as I've read about it and mulled it over, I've become increasingly concerned about the whole thing. One of the main arguments for feeding birds is that \&quot;we've taken away their natural food so we need to replace it\&quot;. It's certainly true that we've removed lots of natural habitat - but why is the focus on replacing it with something so UNnatural?  Step back and think about it for a second. There is nothing in nature like a bird feeder. Nothing that condenses entire local populations, of multiple different species, into a small space for a never-ending supply of food.  Birds have evolved with food sources that come and go with the seasons, so of course, when we give them something so artificial - it's bound to cause problems. I think it's time to switch our focus to giving them something better instead. 🌻Grow plants that produce seeds for the birds to eat. Things like sunflowers, teasels, scabious and cornflowers are all great. The pollinators will thank you too AND you get pretty flowers to look at. 🌳Plant native hedges, bushes and trees that produce fruits, berries, nuts and seeds for birds to eat. They're also home for stacks of insects for them, and a place to make their nests.  💧Make a pond! Whether it's a full one in the ground or a container-pond on a patio, it will attract insect life for birds to feed on and provide a more natural source of water. What if we spent just a fraction of the money, energy and time that we put into bird feeding into making our gardens more wildlife-friendly instead? Imagine if the default thought when we wanted to help the birds wasn't \&quot;what bird feeder should I buy?\&quot; but instead \&quot;which native bush should I plant?\&quot; or \&quot;what flowers should I grow?\&quot; Imagine how much healthier our garden ecosystems would be. We'd be providing food for everything, not just a select few generalist bird species that would be doing just fine anyway without all the food we give them.  Bird feeders have an absolute chokehold on us nature lovers, especially here in the UK, and I think it's time we thought about breaking it.  #birds #science #outdoors #nature #fyp &quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/270-the-algorithm-is-the-road/37fcea45-f23f-4843-83a3-663ae13743e1_848x1131-b76191b3.png&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;jabaddams - Birds 🐦&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40jabaddams%2Fvideo%2F7594911421482192150&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@jabaddams&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40jabaddams%2Fvideo%2F7594911421482192150&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40jabaddams%2Fvideo%2F7594911421482192150&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40jabaddams%2Fvideo%2F7594911421482192150&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jabaddams/video/7594911421482192150" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/270-the-algorithm-is-the-road/37fcea45-f23f-4843-83a3-663ae13743e1_848x1131-b76191b3.png" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!aXSp!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37fcea45-f23f-4843-83a3-663ae13743e1_848x1131.png);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jabaddams" target="_blank">@jabaddams</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jabaddams/video/7594911421482192150" target="_blank">Stop feeding the birds.
