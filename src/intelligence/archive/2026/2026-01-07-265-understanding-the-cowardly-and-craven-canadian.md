A collective lowering of the voice. A glance over the shoulder before speaking. A pre-emptive Canadian apology for having an opinion at all.</p><p>Not because the threat is overwhelming, but because the fear of the threat has become unbearable. We are not reacting to force. We are reacting to the <em>possibility</em> of force. To displeasure. To disapproval. To the raised eyebrow from the south. Forget conquest, it seems anticipation will be sufficient. Obedience before instruction. A voluntary vassal makes while convincing itself it is being prudent.</p><p>Hybrid war does not arrive with sirens. It seeps in through norms, incentives, and atmospheres. It works best when no one feels attacked—only anxious. When people begin to self-censor not because they are told to, but because it feels irresponsible not to. When institutions confuse restraint with maturity and caution with wisdom. When fear dresses itself up as realism.</p><p>And Canadians are great at this.</p><p>We have long told ourselves a story about humility. About being reasonable. About not making a fuss. But beneath that story lurks something darker and far more corrosive: the tall poppy syndrome that punishes visibility, ambition, and deviation. The instinct to cut down anyone who speaks too boldly, too confidently, too far outside the approved lane. The reflex that says: <em>Who do you think you are?</em> The cultural allergy to anyone who refuses to soften their voice.</p><p>In Canada, authority is granted by proximity. Discourse is carefully gated. Only the “knowns” are allowed to speak, and even they must speak carefully. Credentials and reputation matter more than insight. Tone matters more than truth. To challenge power without institutional backing is to invite ridicule, suspicion, or erasure. To speak plainly is to risk being labelled unserious, radical, or irrelevant.</p><p>So when the pressure mounts, we do not even deliberate. We simply… adjust. We pre-trim our policies. We sand down our language. We abandon ideas before they are fully formed. We align without advantage and call it pragmatism.</p><p>The tragedy is not that Canada has always had to navigate American power. Geography makes that unavoidable. The tragedy is that we have stopped pretending we have a choice. We no longer bargain; we anticipate. We no longer resist; we internalize. We no longer ask what we want; we ask what will be tolerated.</p><p>Fear as governing principle.</p><p>And fear is contagious. It spreads from cabinet rooms to newsrooms, from universities to NGOs, from boardrooms to dinner tables. It teaches people to whisper instead of argue. To gesture instead of state. To signal instead of commit. Over time, a country trained this way loses its voice—not because it was silenced, but because it forgot how to use it.</p><p>This is the end that approaches Canada now. Not collapse, but hollowing. Evaporation through inaction.</p><p>What makes this moment so dangerous is the illusion of safety that accompanies compliance. We tell ourselves that obedience buys protection, that alignment buys stability, that keeping our heads down keeps us out of trouble. History teaches the opposite. Power does not reward anticipation; it exploits it. Those who surrender leverage early are not spared—they are absorbed.</p><p>Hybrid war succeeds when the target no longer believes it deserves agency.</p><p>So what needs to be done begins not with policy, but with posture.</p><p>Canada must relearn how to stand upright. How to tolerate loud voices. How to let new actors speak without demanding permission. How to stop cutting down tall poppies simply because they are visible. A society that cannot endure internal disagreement cannot survive external pressure.</p><p>We must widen the gates of discourse, not narrow them. Encourage friction rather than suppress it. Protect dissent not as a moral gesture, but as a strategic necessity. In a world defined by psychological pressure, the ability to argue openly is not a weakness—it is resilience.</p><p>Most of all, we must stop confusing fear with intelligence. Fear feels sophisticated. It feels worldly. It flatters itself as foresight. But fear is lazy. Fear shortcuts thinking. Fear ends countries quietly.</p><p>The end of Canada is not inevitable. But it becomes imaginable the moment we decide that silence is safer than speech, that obedience is smarter than leverage, and that courage is something other people should provide.</p><p>Empires thrive on that belief. A country that wants to survive cannot afford it.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40thewokebloke%2Fvideo%2F7591214873623809294&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@thewokebloke/video/7591214873623809294&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;#venezuela #maduro #leftist #liberal #communism&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/265-understanding-the-cowardly-and-craven-canadian/cf815c2a-4fd2-48d4-8d9e-5b0d3a5a99e9_1080x1920-0d196032.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;thewokebloke&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40thewokebloke%2Fvideo%2F7591214873623809294&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@thewokebloke&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40thewokebloke%2Fvideo%2F7591214873623809294&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40thewokebloke%2Fvideo%2F7591214873623809294&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40thewokebloke%2Fvideo%2F7591214873623809294&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thewokebloke/video/7591214873623809294" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/265-understanding-the-cowardly-and-craven-canadian/cf815c2a-4fd2-48d4-8d9e-5b0d3a5a99e9_1080x1920-0d196032.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X_Cf!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf815c2a-4fd2-48d4-8d9e-5b0d3a5a99e9_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thewokebloke" target="_blank">@thewokebloke</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thewokebloke/video/7591214873623809294" target="_blank">#venezuela #maduro #leftist #liberal #communism</a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40thewokebloke%2Fvideo%2F7591214873623809294&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/265-understanding-the-cowardly-and-craven-canadian/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
