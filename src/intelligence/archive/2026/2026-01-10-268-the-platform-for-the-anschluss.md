It advances on infrastructure.</p><p>In Canada, one of the most consequential pieces of that infrastructure is <strong>Facebook</strong>—not as a social network, but as the country’s dominant local information system. It is where emergencies are named, reputations are made or broken, conflicts are adjudicated, and “what everyone knows” quietly hardens into common sense.</p><p>If <a href="https://metaviews.substack.com/p/267-before-the-anschluss">the Anschluss</a> is the historical lesson about absorption, Facebook explains the preparation.</p><p>Canada did not collectively decide to abandon local journalism. It simply lost it.</p><p>As newspapers closed, newsrooms shrank, and local radio withered, a gap opened at the most sensitive level of democratic life: the town, the neighbourhood, the school, the community association. That gap did not stay empty. Facebook groups moved in.</p><p>Local groups now function as the primary channel for:</p><ul><li><p>local news and rumours</p></li><li><p>political framing</p></li><li><p>crisis interpretation</p></li><li><p>social norm enforcement</p></li><li><p>public shaming and informal justice</p></li></ul><p>This shift happened quietly, without debate, and without consent. It happened because the platform was already there, already habitual, already emotionally embedded in daily life.</p><h3>The legislative failure that entrenched platform power</h3><p>Federal attempts to regulate digital platforms focused narrowly on compensating professional journalism. They treated platforms as distributors rather than as governing infrastructure.</p><p>The outcome was predictable. When Facebook removed news links rather than renegotiate its role, journalism did not disappear from public life. It was displaced. Information re-entered through groups, screenshots, hearsay, and outrage-driven commentary.</p><p>The state aimed to protect media institutions. It ended up accelerating their replacement.</p><p>The result is a media ecosystem where the most influential local narratives are produced by users seeking attention, governed by opaque moderation, optimized for engagement, and shielded from public accountability.</p><p>In this context, Facebook groups are no longer informal gathering spaces. They operate as governing arenas.</p><p>They decide:</p><ul><li><p>which issues are legitimate</p></li><li><p>which voices are credible</p></li><li><p>which behaviours are punishable</p></li><li><p>which interpretations dominate</p></li></ul><p>Admins hold unchecked power. Rules change without notice. Enforcement is arbitrary. Appeals are rare or nonexistent. Outcomes are shaped by volume, speed, and emotional intensity.</p><p>For many Canadians, these spaces feel more immediate and consequential than municipal councils or local papers. That immediacy translates into legitimacy, even when accuracy and fairness are absent.</p><p>The hostility, paranoia, pile-ons, and moral absolutism common in local Facebook groups are not anomalies. They are the predictable product of a system tuned to reward reaction over reflection.</p><p>Anger spreads faster than correction. Certainty travels further than nuance. Identity claims outperform evidence. These dynamics do not require coordination. They emerge automatically under conditions of algorithmic amplification and social scarcity.</p><p>Hybrid war benefits from exactly this environment. It fragments shared reality at the smallest social units while exhausting people emotionally. Participation feels constant. Agency feels present. Structural power remains untouched.</p><p>In the historical analogy, Facebook occupies the role of connective tissue.</p><p>It does not dictate ideology. It organizes perception. It shapes what feels popular, what feels risky to say, and what feels settled. It narrows the range of acceptable interpretation long before formal politics engages.</p><p>This function is strategic. Control over visibility, circulation, and social consequence is enough to steer outcomes without issuing commands. Absorption becomes procedural.</p><p>As a result, Canada now operates with overlapping systems of authority:</p><ul><li><p>formal democratic institutions that persist but feel distant</p></li><li><p>platform-governed communities that feel intimate but answer to no one</p></li></ul><p>When these systems collide, people increasingly defer to the latter because they are present, immediate, and emotionally binding.</p><p>This erosion of institutional relevance is not accidental. It is the result of authority migrating into spaces optimized for engagement rather than deliberation.</p><p>Canada’s vulnerability is not widespread gullibility. It is the normalization of a media environment where reality is negotiated through private infrastructure governed by foreign corporate logic.</p><p>When local meaning-making is outsourced, sovereignty erodes without announcement. The country continues to function, but its capacity to reason collectively weakens.</p><p>This is how inevitability is built. Not through national declarations, but through thousands of local group decisions that quietly train people to accept certain narratives as obvious and others as unacceptable.</p><p>Austria’s lesson was that absorption was complete before it was visible.</p><p>Facebook’s lesson is how preparation happens now.</p><p>By the time the consequences are undeniable, the infrastructure that produced them is already indispensable.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40rachel_gilmore%2Fvideo%2F7593442717661957432&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@rachel_gilmore/video/7593442717661957432&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;This story is actually about something much bigger.
