A moment of relative calm before the winds of change roar once more.</p><p>NYC faces an election of seismic significance. The Canadian government will table a federal budget that is expected to lead to another federal election. The US government faces ongoing shutdown and significant rulings from the Supreme Court.</p><p>Meanwhile rumours flourish regarding the construction of a secure bunker under the East Wing of the White House to resist and outlast electoral defeat. Senior ranking government officials take up residence on military bases to increase personal security. Food insecurity increases as the food system reacts to general uncertainty, the coming of winter, and turbulences in international trade. Energy prices fluctuate with data centre construction and ongoing threats against energy producers like Venezuela and Nigeria.</p><p>Making sense of all this often requires a kind of AI cadence that helps frame the narrative and news in metaphors and pairings that the algo trained mind can comprehend. Yet a greater opportunity is to embrace a kind of cyber surrealism that focuses on the Internet as the ultimate authority.</p><p>For decades we dismissed the Internet as a distraction or a representation that was “not the real world”. Not only was that a fatal mistake for liberal democracy, but it turns out that the real world was just a mediocre MTV show. Everything we were told as kids were lies, and only now is the network of networks enabling us to weave a narrative together that makes sense to most if not all of us.</p><p>The model is never the actual thing, but the Internet is also not a model, even if it enables a kind of modelling that is unprecedented. A larger problem is why as a society we have not spent time trying to understand the Internet, and how to align ourselves with the affordances and abilities it can offer.</p><p>There are many ways we can prepare for the storm we find ourselves in, and here in the eye, we have a good opportunity to retool and reconfigure. Ask yourself what you’re doing to make sense, to respond, to act with agency.</p><p>Act now, as you may not be able to act later. With each act, you gain the ability to take other actions. Use it or lose it. Take it, or it will be taken from you. Vote early, vote often.</p><p>The internet user who describes themselves as a user is probably being used.</p><p>The internet user who describes themselves as a learner is probably being fused with a new emergent form of intelligence that has nothing to do with AI or anything artificial.</p><p>The hacker who describes themselves as a friend is exactly the friend you want to know.</p><p>The friend who does not describe but instead offers care is more than a friend and someone worthy of your love.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cfr_org%2Fvideo%2F7567504890730155277&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@cfr_org/video/7567504890730155277&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;\&quot;Mike Johnson has effectively dissolved the United States House of Representatives because the president of the United States asked him to. That is insane,\&quot; says Representative and Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee Adam Smith (D-WA). Smith notes the House has not been in session since September 19, which he characterizes as unprecedented, emphasizing that it should instead be finalizing the budget and the NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act). He notes that the unusual pause is undermining oversight, legislation, and efforts to address the shutdown. Smith also warns that SNAP benefits are set to expire, and that President Trump is choosing not to use emergency funds that were set aside for the payments. 🔗 Watch the full conversation at the link in our bio. #GovernmentShutdown #Congress #Trump #Republicans&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/243-the-eye-of-the-storm/f0e8554b-521f-487c-8a64-d7b3835feea0_1080x1920-8c2eab4f.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Council on Foreign Relations&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cfr_org%2Fvideo%2F7567504890730155277&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@cfr_org&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cfr_org%2Fvideo%2F7567504890730155277&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cfr_org%2Fvideo%2F7567504890730155277&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cfr_org%2Fvideo%2F7567504890730155277&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cfr_org/video/7567504890730155277" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/243-the-eye-of-the-storm/f0e8554b-521f-487c-8a64-d7b3835feea0_1080x1920-8c2eab4f.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WngU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff0e8554b-521f-487c-8a64-d7b3835feea0_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cfr_org" target="_blank">@cfr_org</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cfr_org/video/7567504890730155277" target="_blank">"Mike Johnson has effectively dissolved the United States House of Representatives because the president of the United States asked him to.
