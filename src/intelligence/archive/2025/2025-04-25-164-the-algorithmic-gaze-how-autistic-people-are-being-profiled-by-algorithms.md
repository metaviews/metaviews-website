Every pause, every scroll, every deviation from the norm becomes a signal. These systems weren’t built to understand us. They were built to sort us. And increasingly, they’re sorting people not just by demographics or politics, but by neurology.</p><p>You don’t need a clinical diagnosis to be profiled. Your behavior is enough.</p><p>For autistic people, this poses a profound danger: not just of misrecognition, but of preemptive classification. Not for care, but for control.</p><p>Most people assume autism is a medical category, formally assessed. But in the eyes of algorithmic systems, autism becomes a behavioral pattern — inferable from:</p><ul><li><p>Language use (e.g., literalism, repetition, formality)</p></li><li><p>Social media engagement (e.g., frequency, time of posting)</p></li><li><p>Clickstream data (e.g., non-linear browsing, deep dives)</p></li><li><p>Eye movement and facial expressions (e.g., video conferencing platforms)</p></li><li><p>Sensory preferences (e.g., autoplay behavior, audio sensitivity in streaming)</p></li></ul><p>The AI doesn’t diagnose. It categorizes. It flags.</p><p>These aren’t tools of understanding. They’re instruments of sorting and suspicion.</p><h3><strong>Why Autistic People Are a Target</strong></h3><p>Autistic people often challenge consensus. We notice patterns others ignore. We ask “why” when we’re told “just because.” We don’t perform the social scripts that authoritarianism demands.</p><p>In regimes like Trump’s, where obedience is virtue and compliance is currency, these differences are not tolerated. They are pathologized. What begins as digital profiling becomes grounds for exclusion: from opportunities, from public spaces, even from the national community.</p><p>In such systems, difference is treated as deviance. And deviance, as a threat.</p><p>The Trump regime has already attacked DEI, targeted trans healthcare, and undermined disability rights. What’s emerging now is a shift from diagnosis to designation — where AI decides who is unstable, unfit, or unsafe.</p><p>You don’t need to see a psychologist. You just need to deviate from the dataset.</p><p>This is already happening. Immigrants are subject to AI-powered behavioral screening. Hiring platforms quietly filter candidates based on “cultural fit,” often code for neurotypical norms. EdTech software flags “at-risk” students based on engagement patterns — a euphemism for being different.</p><p>These systems do not ask <em>what support you need</em>. They ask <em>whether you are normal</em>.</p><h3><strong>A Politics of Recognition: Toward Neurodivergent Power</strong></h3><p>Encryption won’t save us. Obfuscation won’t liberate us. What we need is visibility — on our own terms. Solidarity, not silence. Recognition, not retreat.</p><p>Resistance can look like public space occupied by neurodivergent presence. Autistic-led events, teach-ins, art shows, podcasts. Refuse invisibility. Reframe autism as part of civic life, not a deviation from it.</p><p>It means demanding algorithmic accountability. Pushing for transparency in the systems that classify us. Requiring audit trails, appeal processes, and the right to know when your neurotype is inferred.</p><p>It means building solidarity networks — mutual aid circles rooted in recognition, not pity. A culture of peer support, not institutional gaslighting. A politics of co-survival.</p><p>It means redesigning institutions — schools, workplaces, digital platforms — around the lived experience of neurodivergence. Not accommodations that make us tolerable, but systems that make us central.</p><p>And it means reclaiming the narrative. Autistic stories, histories, and aesthetics should flood the media, reshape the cultural field, and challenge the authority of systems that pathologize difference.</p><blockquote><p><em>“Autism is not a defect. It’s a dissent.”</em></p></blockquote><h3><strong>Seeing Through the System</strong></h3><p>The algorithmic gaze does not see you. It sees a probability, a pattern, a deviation from the mean. To counter it, we must <em>see each other</em> — in our difference, our strength, and our refusal to be sorted.</p><p>Recognition is politics. It is power.</p><p>Autistic people do not need to be saved. We need to be respected. Defended. Centered. Especially now, as authoritarian systems redraw the boundary between inclusion and exclusion, normalcy and deviance.</p><p>If we are to defend democracy, we must also defend difference. Because the future of authority may depend on how we treat those who defy categorization.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40addielamarr%2Fvideo%2F7496677569719176490&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@addielamarr/video/7496677569719176490&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;You’re not imagining it — the world is getting darker. And if you feel angry, heartbroken, or helpless?
