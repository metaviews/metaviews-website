But the crowd was still thick, banners and hand-painted signs catching the sunlight between the tall government buildings. Chants bounced off the walls: <em>“Whose streets? OUR streets!”</em></p><p>This rally was different. Trump’s “Public Safety &amp; Security Executive Order” had dropped three days ago, and the ink was barely dry before the Guard rolled in. Armored trucks at intersections. Full combat gear. A city under federal occupation.</p><p>I panned the phone across the avenue for the viewers. “National Guard holding at two blocks out,” I said into the mic. “Protest holding firm on Penn.”</p><p>That’s when I saw them.</p><p>About forty guys on a side street, not Guard, not cops. Flag t-shirts, motorcycle helmets, tactical vests, improvised shields. Some had flagpoles, some had pistols under loose shirts. Far-right regulars. They were forming up, waiting for a cue.</p><p>And that’s when I noticed her.</p><p>She was leaning on a lamppost beside me like she’d been there the whole time, no camera, no sign. Just scanning the street like she was making a map in her head.</p><p>She caught my eye, then nodded toward two brass players — a trumpet and a trombone — who’d been hanging back near the tail end of the march. She said something I couldn’t catch, and they both grinned and started walking toward the side street.</p><p>By the time I swung my phone that way, she was gone.</p><p>The brass players planted themselves ten feet from the counter-protesters and started blasting a jagged, glorious riff — part protest song, part pure noise. It ricocheted between the buildings, swallowing the shouts from the far-right crew.</p><p>Then, out of nowhere, a convoy of food delivery cyclists streamed right through their formation. “On your left!” they shouted, swerving just enough to break their lines without making contact. Half the counter-protesters spun around, yelling, totally losing focus.</p><p>From above, a massive banner unfurled down the face of an office building, wide enough to block the street. I couldn’t read all of it from my angle, but the words <em>“NO QUARTER”</em> were painted big enough to fill the frame.</p><p>The Guard slowed their advance, radios crackling. You could see the confusion in their body language — they weren’t sure whether to move on the music, the cyclists, or the rally.</p><p>Meanwhile, the march slipped away down 12th Street, two blocks over, safe from both Guard and counter-protesters. Most of the crowd didn’t even know how close it had come to going bad.</p><p>I kept my stream running for another hour, following the protest to its dispersal. When I finally went back to pack up my tripod from where I’d left it, there was something folded and taped under the clamp.</p><p>In block letters, hand-scrawled:</p><p><em>“Play louder than the war they’re bringing.”</em></p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40howdyhowdyyall1%2Fvideo%2F7537349239777643790&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@howdyhowdyyall1/video/7537349239777643790&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;To me it makes sense #howdy &quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/232-play-louder-than-the-war-they-bring/3d5e5e0b-94dc-41ab-a2eb-720e1f4ae1e8_1080x1920-ce24865a.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;howdyhowdyyall&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40howdyhowdyyall1%2Fvideo%2F7537349239777643790&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@howdyhowdyyall1&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40howdyhowdyyall1%2Fvideo%2F7537349239777643790&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40howdyhowdyyall1%2Fvideo%2F7537349239777643790&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40howdyhowdyyall1%2Fvideo%2F7537349239777643790&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@howdyhowdyyall1/video/7537349239777643790" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/232-play-louder-than-the-war-they-bring/3d5e5e0b-94dc-41ab-a2eb-720e1f4ae1e8_1080x1920-ce24865a.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mfLE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3d5e5e0b-94dc-41ab-a2eb-720e1f4ae1e8_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@howdyhowdyyall1" target="_blank">@howdyhowdyyall1</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@howdyhowdyyall1/video/7537349239777643790" target="_blank">To me it makes sense #howdy </a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40howdyhowdyyall1%2Fvideo%2F7537349239777643790&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/232-play-louder-than-the-war-they-bring/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
