Hey friends!</p><p>We're back!</p><p>Episode 16: Resurgence

After a long hiatus, Metaviews to the Future returns with a renewed sense of purpose.</p><p>In this special episode, we reflect on the journey of Metaviews so far—its origins, milestones, and the critical conversations that have defined our work.</p><p>This moment of resurgence marks the beginning of a new chapter, as we double down on our mission to envision a future of authority that serves everyone.</p><p>Against the backdrop of rising authoritarianism, we explore how to look beyond its grip, toward its eventual collapse and failure.</p><p>What does it take to build systems of power rooted in wisdom, nature, and participation?</p><p>Join us as we examine the past, embrace the present, and chart a course for a more just and funky future.</p><p>The stakes couldn’t be higher, and the conversation starts here.
