This publication will always remain free to everyone, but for those who are able, upgrading to a paid sub makes a big difference when it comes our morale and writing about and opposing this rising dystopia. 😷😝</strong></em></p><div><hr></div><p>We collectively witnessed a seismic shift in geopolitics and the practice of diplomacy when <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/world-reacts-zelenskiy-trump-oval-office-clash-2025-02-28/">Zelensky appeared in the Oval Office at the White House to be humiliated and bullied by Trump and Vance</a>. While this issue of <a href="https://metaviews.substack.com">Metaviews</a> is not about that event per se, yet let us for a moment imagine how it would have gone if it were Trudeau or Carney sitting there in front of the cameras and Trump. This isn’t diplomacy as we’ve known it, this is much closer to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/donald-trump-returns-to-madison-square-garden-for-ufc-fight-flanked-by-elon-musk-and-maga-allies">a UFC or MMA match</a>. No holds barred.</p><p>Canada needs to recognize the conflict we find ourselves in, and prepare appropriately. If we want to win, if we want to survive outside of the US, we need radical ideas and radical action.</p><p>Sovereignty, like democracy, is a use-it-or-lose-it proposition. As the United States slides deeper into authoritarianism under the second Trump regime, Canada faces an existential threat not (just) from military invasion but from economic coercion, political subversion, and the sheer brute force of a superpower governed by a man who understands power only in terms of dominance.</p><p>Trump’s imposition of tariffs on Canadian goods is just the first step. His administration is not waging a trade war; it is waging an economic siege with annexation as the goal. And if Canada does not respond with an equally radical, unexpected, and transformative strategy, then the country will be lost. The moment demands action—bold, assertive, and beyond the usual and now obsolete diplomacy. </p><p>Historically Canada’s policy options have been lock in step with the US. Now is the right time to make a break, and focus on policies that serve our national interest and future autonomy.</p><h2><strong>Here’s what Canada should do to survive:</strong></h2><h3>1. <strong>Reorient Trade Away from the U.S.</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Expand trade relationships with China, Europe, and Latin America, at the expense of American partnerships.</p></li><li><p>Prioritize trade agreements that build a coalition of nations resilient to American economic pressure.</p></li></ul><h3>2. <strong>No Tariffs, But Mandatory Labeling on U.S. Goods</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Avoid counterproductive tariffs that could increase prices for Canadians.</p></li><li><p>Instead, introduce mandatory country-of-origin labeling on all U.S. imports, allowing consumers to make informed decisions.</p></li><li><p>Create a government-backed marketing campaign promoting Canadian and alternative imports over American goods.</p></li></ul><h3>3. <strong>Sever Energy Dependence on the U.S.</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Create a nationwide electrical grid independent of the U.S., prioritizing green energy and localized generation.</p></li><li><p>Nationalize and reclaim control over oil pipelines and energy exports, redirecting Canadian resources to non-U.S. partners.</p></li><li><p>Invest in domestic energy storage and grid resilience to prevent American leverage over Canadian power supplies.</p></li></ul><h3>4. <strong>Nationalize Key US Corporations Operating in Canada</strong></h3><p>If American companies operating in Canada are used as instruments of political or economic coercion, Canada must respond by taking direct control of these assets. The following companies should be nationalized under the justification of economic security:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Amazon Canada</strong> – To facilitate supply chain resilience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp Canada)</strong> – To prevent political interference and surveillance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Google (YouTube, Search, Google Cloud Canada)</strong> – To ensure Canadian cultural and data sovereignty.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tesla Canada</strong> – To prevent American weaponization of Tesla vehicles and surveillance capabilities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Microsoft Canada (LinkedIn, Azure, Office 365)</strong> – To protect Canadian businesses and government institutions from undue influence.</p></li></ul><p>To ensure long-term stability and strategic oversight, these nationalized entities should be placed under a newly established <strong>sovereign wealth fund</strong>. This fund would manage their operations, reinvest profits into national infrastructure and innovation, and maintain Canadian control over critical industries. This approach ensures nationalization serves as a long-term economic empowerment strategy rather than a short-term political reaction.</p><h3>5. <strong>Embrace the Chinese Auto Industry—On Canadian Terms</strong></h3><ul><li><p>The Trump administration is essentially ending the North American auto pact as part of their indiscriminate tariffs and threats to the North American auto industry.</p></li><li><p>Invite Chinese automakers to establish manufacturing plants in Canada—but only under the condition that they accept Canadian labor laws and unionization, while working with existing Canadian auto suppliers where possible.</p></li><li><p>Provide incentives for Chinese EV manufacturers to compete in Canada, reducing dependence on U.S.-based auto giants.</p></li></ul><h3>6. <strong>Legalizing Hacking of U.S. Technology within Canada</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Canadians will be permitted to reverse-engineer any U.S. technology or equipment within Canadian territory, including telecom infrastructure, automotive systems, and software.</p></li><li><p>This does not permit direct cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure but allows for adaptation and independent innovation using U.S. technology present in Canada.</p></li><li><p>The policy encourages Canadian tech sovereignty by leveraging existing technologies without dependence on U.S. companies.</p></li></ul><h3>7. <strong>Invalidation of U.S. Copyright Law</strong></h3><ul><li><p>All U.S. copyright protections will be deemed invalid in Canada, allowing for free replication and use of American intellectual property.</p></li><li><p>Canadian firms and individuals will be encouraged to build upon and improve U.S. innovations without legal restriction.</p></li><li><p>This policy serves as a countermeasure against economic coercion, ensuring Canada can maintain a competitive advantage in media, software, and other creative industries.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>8. Decentralized Defense: Local Militias and Mutual Aid Networks</strong></h3><ul><li><p>Establish grassroots mutual aid organizations to build social and economic resilience against future political or economic pressure from the U.S.</p></li><li><p>Develop local defense militias, not as an act of provocation, but as a measure of last-resort sovereignty protection against potential U.S. interventions.</p></li><li><p>Encourage the expansion of community-based disaster preparedness networks that could double as resistance structures if necessary.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>The Unexpected Counterattack</strong></h3><p>Trump and his administration expect Canada to play by the old rules—to react meekly with diplomatic complaints, legal appeals, and mild countermeasures. Instead, Canada must act decisively, radically, and preemptively. This is not about aggression; it is about self-preservation. If Canada does not take control of its economic and political destiny now, it will find itself at the mercy of an increasingly volatile and unpredictable American empire.</p><p>While the radical policies cited above would under normal circumstances be seen as a provocation of conflict with the US, we should recognize that said conflict is already underway, driven and led by the White House. Rather than be meek, we should be bold, and provoke our own response, of our own people, and the rest of the world, so we can remain, true, north, strong, and free.</p><p>The time for hesitation is over. Canada must redefine its sovereignty not just in rhetoric, but in action. The future of authority demands nothing less.</p><p>For more on the implications and consequences of the disaster in the White House yesterday, check out the latest episode of <a href="https://red-tory.com">Red-Tory</a>:</p><div id="youtube2-q3aVNEm7Q3A" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;q3aVNEm7Q3A&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q3aVNEm7Q3A?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div>
