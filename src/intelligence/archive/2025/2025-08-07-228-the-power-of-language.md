Many argued convincingly that they do, challenging long-held anthropocentric assumptions. Language, after all, may not be exclusive to humans, even if its structures differ across species.</p><p>We also wrestled with the viral nature of language: its ability to spread, mutate, and infect. Language is a force that inhabits us as much as we wield it—shaping perception, encoding power, and scaffolding our understanding of reality. It is both deeply social and intensely contextual, shifting meaning depending on time, place, and speaker.</p><p>In a world of proliferating dialects and splintered platforms, we noted how common meaning feels increasingly rare. Language is flourishing in diversity, yet fragmented in cohesion. Are we losing the ability to understand each other even as we gain new ways to express ourselves?</p><p>It was, once again, a brilliant gathering—part provocation, part poetry. The Metaviews salon continues to prove that spontaneous conversation, when anchored in curiosity and care, can illuminate what formal discourse often obscures.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40thenickylawrence%2Fvideo%2F7533714672399224070&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@thenickylawrence/video/7533714672399224070&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Maple and Melanin🍁 Emancipation Day 🇨🇦 Today is Emancipation in Canada. 🇨🇦✊🏾 Not a gift a fight.
