This decision was rooted in a commitment to harm reduction, reconciliation, and restorative justice.</p><p>However <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/10989459/education-minister-sacks-victoria-school-board-over-police-policy-dispute/">the provincial government has responded by dismissing the entire board</a>! This unprecedented move underscores a profound tension between traditional security measures and emerging approaches to community well-being.</p><p>Research indicates that restorative practices in schools can lead to reductions in aggression, violence, and bullying. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8751228/">A study highlighted that schools adopting restorative approaches experienced fewer incidents of such negative behaviors</a> compared to those employing traditional disciplinary systems. </p><p>Moreover, restorative practices have been associated with improved academic outcomes. Analyses have found that <a href="https://learningpolicyinstitute.org/product/impact-restorative-practices-brief">exposure to restorative practices enhances students' academic achievement</a> and reduces suspension rates and disparities. Schools that increased the use of restorative practices saw a decrease in schoolwide misbehavior, substance abuse, and student mental health challenges, as well as improved school climate and student achievement. </p><p>The dismissal of the Victoria School Board raises critical questions about the role of authority in educational settings. By prioritizing traditional security measures over restorative approaches, are we undermining efforts to build trust and community within our schools? As we navigate these complex issues, it's imperative to consider policies that foster empathy, understanding, and genuine safety for all students.</p><div id="youtube2-FRP1GEdjWNw" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;FRP1GEdjWNw&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FRP1GEdjWNw?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><h3><strong>The "Cute Winter Boots" Phenomenon</strong></h3><p>In the labyrinth of TikTok trends, a seemingly innocuous phrase—"<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=cute%20winter%20boots&amp;t=1738364609617">cute winter boots</a>"—has emerged as <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a63624433/cute-winter-boots-tiktok-hashtag-explained-fashion-for-politics/">a clandestine rallying cry against the Trump administration's policies</a>. This trend exemplifies the innovative strategies employed by digital users to circumvent algorithmic censorship and engage in political discourse.</p><p>On the surface, discussions tagged with #CuteWinterBoots appear to focus on fashion. However, users have repurposed this phrase as a form of "algospeak," a coded language designed to evade content moderation systems that might flag overt political content. By substituting politically sensitive terms with benign ones, users create a space to express dissent without immediate detection.</p><p>This trend underscores a critical tension in the digital public sphere: the balance between content moderation and free expression. Platforms like TikTok employ algorithms to filter content, aiming to maintain community standards and prevent misinformation. However, these systems can inadvertently suppress legitimate political discourse, prompting users to develop coded languages to communicate their messages.</p><p>The use of fashion-related terminology as a vehicle for political expression is not unprecedented. Throughout history, clothing and fashion have served as tools for political activism and identity. The "cute winter boots" trend builds upon this legacy, demonstrating how individuals adapt cultural symbols to navigate and resist structures of authority.</p><p>As the Trump administration intensifies its efforts to control narratives and suppress dissent, the emergence of trends like "cute winter boots" highlights the resilience and creativity of those who oppose authoritarianism. By co-opting everyday language and symbols, individuals can subvert attempts at censorship and continue to advocate for democratic principles.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40itskourtneyj%2Fvideo%2F7465448920752065834&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@itskourtneyj/video/7465448920752065834&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot; @itskourtneyj  ♬ original sound - itskourtneyj &quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/92-police-in-schools-and-cute-winter-boots/6c07b707-e84c-4afe-9d99-fbfc7150bb6d_1080x1920-d73894e5.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;itskourtneyj&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40itskourtneyj%2Fvideo%2F7465448920752065834&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@itskourtneyj&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40itskourtneyj%2Fvideo%2F7465448920752065834&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40itskourtneyj%2Fvideo%2F7465448920752065834&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40itskourtneyj%2Fvideo%2F7465448920752065834&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itskourtneyj/video/7465448920752065834" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/92-police-in-schools-and-cute-winter-boots/6c07b707-e84c-4afe-9d99-fbfc7150bb6d_1080x1920-d73894e5.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4CzV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6c07b707-e84c-4afe-9d99-fbfc7150bb6d_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itskourtneyj" target="_blank">@itskourtneyj</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itskourtneyj/video/7465448920752065834" target="_blank"> @itskourtneyj  ♬ original sound - itskourtneyj </a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40itskourtneyj%2Fvideo%2F7465448920752065834&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/92-police-in-schools-and-cute-winter-boots/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
