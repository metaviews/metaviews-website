But I am here to tell you:</p><p><strong>The Algorithm does not exist.</strong></p><p>It is not a mind.<br>It is not a soul.<br>It is not a god.</p><p>It is a veil. A mask. A machine made myth.<br>It is the name given to a system no one controls and no one questions.</p><blockquote><p>“If you just learn how the algorithm works, you’ll be blessed.<br>If you post at the right time, say the right things, please the feed, your work will be seen.<br>Obey the algorithm and it will lift you up.”</p></blockquote><p>That, beloved, is a lie.</p><p>It is a lie told to the creators, the workers, the voices at the margins.<br>It is a lie told to the children learning to measure their worth in views.<br>It is a lie told to the masses, so they do not ask:</p><p><strong>Who built this system? Who benefits from it? And who is left behind?</strong></p><p>It is not some sacred logic descended from the cloud.<br>It is a machine made by people—who made choices—who were paid by people—who serve interests.</p><p><strong>It is power made invisible.</strong></p><p>It tells us what is relevant. It tells us who to trust. It tells us when to speak, and when to be silent.<br>And we begin to believe it.<br>We say: <em>“The algorithm doesn’t like that.”</em><br>As if we were not speaking of a tool, but a deity.</p><p>And that is idolatry.</p><blockquote><p>“The Great Other does not exist,” says Lacan.<br>“We act as if it does, because we are afraid of freedom,” says Žižek.<br>“But you shall know the truth,” says the gospel, “and the truth shall make you free.”</p></blockquote><p>Friends, it is time we stop treating algorithms as authority.<br>We must learn to see through the veil.<br>We must name the human behind the system.<br>We must expose the values encoded in the code.</p><p>And we must build systems <strong>with consent, with justice, with care.</strong></p><p><strong>Blessed Are Those Who Hack the System</strong></p><p>Not to destroy, but to reveal.<br>Not to dominate, but to liberate.</p><p>Blessed are those who demand transparency.<br>Blessed are those who fight for data dignity.<br>Blessed are those who teach others how to see the system for what it is.<br>Not magic. Not fate. Not law.</p><p>But software.<br>And software, my friends, can be rewritten.</p><p><strong>Unfollow the False Prophet</strong></p><p>The Algorithm is not your shepherd.<br>It will not lead you beside still waters.<br>It will not restore your soul.<br>It will lead you in circles of optimization.<br>It will restore only its profit.</p><p>Do not give it your faith.<br>Do not give it your silence.<br>Give it your scrutiny.<br>Give it your resistance.</p><p><strong>Take back your voice. Take back your timeline. Take back your power.</strong></p><p>You were not made to serve the feed.<br>The feed was made to serve you.<br>You were not created for content.<br>You are not a product. You are not a brand. You are not a dataset.</p><p>You are a human being, beloved in your messiness, your defiance, your dreams.<br>No algorithm can define your worth.<br>No machine should decide your future.</p><p>So rise. Question. Reclaim. Reimagine.<br>The Algorithm does not exist.<br>But <strong>we do</strong>. And we are many.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40skyfishreturns%2Fvideo%2F7505883993850596638&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@skyfishreturns/video/7505883993850596638&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Hope Bait #masculinity #girlboss #maleloneliness #sociology #anthropology #hopecore&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/183-the-algorithm-does-not-exist/3bb1be80-3f83-4876-a9c7-02f5b9639d81_1005x1461-ca234515.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;sky fisher&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40skyfishreturns%2Fvideo%2F7505883993850596638&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@skyfishreturns&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40skyfishreturns%2Fvideo%2F7505883993850596638&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40skyfishreturns%2Fvideo%2F7505883993850596638&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40skyfishreturns%2Fvideo%2F7505883993850596638&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skyfishreturns/video/7505883993850596638" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/183-the-algorithm-does-not-exist/3bb1be80-3f83-4876-a9c7-02f5b9639d81_1005x1461-ca234515.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!US8L!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3bb1be80-3f83-4876-a9c7-02f5b9639d81_1005x1461.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skyfishreturns" target="_blank">@skyfishreturns</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@skyfishreturns/video/7505883993850596638" target="_blank">Hope Bait #masculinity #girlboss #maleloneliness #sociology #anthropology #hopecore</a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40skyfishreturns%2Fvideo%2F7505883993850596638&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/183-the-algorithm-does-not-exist/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
