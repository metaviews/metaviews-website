Kennedy Jr., nominated to head the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), spotlight a troubling paradox in modern medical science. While the last five years have seen breathtaking advancements in medical research, science, and practice, the same period has been marked by a dangerous erosion of trust in medical institutions and experts. This loss of authority threatens not just public health, but the very fabric of a functioning democratic society.</p><p>Kennedy, a vocal anti-vaccine activist and purveyor of medical misinformation, exemplifies this decline in trust. His rise as a figure of influence capitalizes on a very real and legitimate skepticism of Big Pharma, but twists it into unfounded conspiracies and false beliefs about medicine.</p><p>From unproven ideas about vaccines to peddling unregulated supplements, figures like Kennedy represent a growing movement of grifters who exploit public fear and frustration for personal gain. If confirmed, Kennedy’s leadership at HHS would elevate this dangerous ideology into a position of immense authority, with potentially catastrophic consequences for public health.</p><h3>Public Health Is Dead. Now What?</h3><p>Public health as we know it is dead, killed by conspiracists and the systemic failures they exploited. The question now is not how to bring it back to life, but how to build a new generation of public health methodologies that are rooted in emerging methods of effective communication. These new methods must be inclusive, participatory, and centered on those with the greatest experience and vulnerability: people experiencing disability. They have the lived expertise and the most at stake in creating a healthcare system that truly works for everyone.</p><p>The irony of this moment cannot be overstated. We live in an era of unprecedented medical breakthroughs—mRNA vaccines developed in record time, revolutionary cancer treatments, and advances in personalized medicine are just a few examples. Yet, instead of rallying around these achievements, many people have turned away from medical science altogether.</p><p>This paradox is not without context. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant vulnerabilities in how medical authorities communicate and operate. Missteps in public messaging, coupled with the political and economic entanglements of pharmaceutical companies, created fertile ground for mistrust. Into this void stepped opportunists like Kennedy, who combined kernels of truth—such as the outsized influence of Big Pharma—with a cascade of lies designed to sow doubt and fear.</p><p>When people lose trust in medical science, they don’t just jeopardize their own health; they undermine the collective trust that makes democratic governance possible. Public health systems rely on shared responsibility and mutual agreement on basic facts. Vaccination campaigns, pandemic responses, and even routine medical care depend on a level of trust that is increasingly frayed. </p><h3>Empowering Patients and People with Disabilities</h3><p>The challenge, then, is how to restore trust in medical science without dismissing the very real concerns that fuel skepticism. The solution lies not in doubling down on top-down authority, but in radically rethinking how patients engage with the medical system. Even more critically, we must prioritize leadership from people experiencing disability, who bring essential perspectives and experiences to the table. To counteract the influence of figures like RFK Jr. and Dr. Oz, we need to place these voices at the very center of the healthcare system and the broader medical debate.</p><h4>Participatory Research</h4><p>Patient participation in medical research—from shaping study design to analyzing outcomes—can democratize science and make it more responsive to public concerns. Initiatives like patient-led clinical trials and citizen science projects bridge the gap between experts and the public, fostering trust and collaboration. Incorporating people with disabilities into these processes ensures that the most vulnerable are leading the charge for equitable, effective solutions.</p><h4>Patient-Centric and Disability-Centric Care</h4><p>Healthcare systems must move beyond paternalistic models to truly empower patients, particularly those experiencing disability. This includes shared decision-making, transparent communication about treatment options, and addressing the social determinants of health that disproportionately impact marginalized communities. When patients and people with disabilities feel heard and respected, they are less likely to fall prey to conspiracies and more likely to engage constructively with evidence-based medicine.</p><h4>Inclusive Public Health Messaging</h4><p>Public health communication needs to be inclusive, empathetic, and accessible. This means acknowledging past mistakes, addressing systemic inequities, and using trusted community voices to disseminate accurate information. People with disabilities must play a leading role in crafting these messages to ensure they resonate with diverse audiences. Combating misinformation requires more than debunking; it requires building relationships and trust over time.</p><h3>A Fork in the Road</h3><p>Today’s confirmation hearings for RFK Jr. are a microcosm of the larger battle for the future of medical authority. Will we allow opportunists and grifters to erode the foundations of public health, or will we seize this moment to rebuild trust and inclusivity in medical science? The choice is ours, and the stakes couldn’t be higher.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40lizzietraveler%2Fvideo%2F7464711176941784362&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@lizzietraveler/video/7464711176941784362&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;#h5n1 update for January 27, 2025: holy 💩&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/89-the-declining-authority-of-medical-science/2b34e7aa-d7d1-4465-aa70-f87afa163cb7_1080x1920-8dcf2f0d.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Lizzietraveler&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40lizzietraveler%2Fvideo%2F7464711176941784362&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@lizzietraveler&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40lizzietraveler%2Fvideo%2F7464711176941784362&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40lizzietraveler%2Fvideo%2F7464711176941784362&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40lizzietraveler%2Fvideo%2F7464711176941784362&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lizzietraveler/video/7464711176941784362" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/89-the-declining-authority-of-medical-science/2b34e7aa-d7d1-4465-aa70-f87afa163cb7_1080x1920-8dcf2f0d.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!FswP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b34e7aa-d7d1-4465-aa70-f87afa163cb7_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lizzietraveler" target="_blank">@lizzietraveler</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lizzietraveler/video/7464711176941784362" target="_blank">#h5n1 update for January 27, 2025: holy 💩</a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40lizzietraveler%2Fvideo%2F7464711176941784362&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/89-the-declining-authority-of-medical-science/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div><p>Democracy thrives when people feel empowered, informed, and engaged. Medicine, as a cornerstone of public trust, must reflect these values. By centering patients, people with disabilities, and communities in every aspect of healthcare—from research to policy—we can chart a path forward that strengthens both public health and democracy. The alternative is a world where figures like RFK Jr. define the narrative, with disastrous consequences for us all.</p><div id="youtube2-w8G6FyS678U" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;w8G6FyS678U&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w8G6FyS678U?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div>
