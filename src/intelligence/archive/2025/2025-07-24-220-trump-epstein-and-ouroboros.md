It’s a perfect metaphor for power in crisis, for systems that can’t break free of their own cycles, and for nations that can no longer distinguish between destruction and rebirth.</p><p>In the U.S., we’re watching the Ouroboros writ large. Donald Trump, once the undisputed avatar of the MAGA movement, is now being circled by his own base, as the Nerd Reich plots in the shadows. Whispers of betrayal, deep state collusion, and moral failure are turning inward. The movement, designed to purge the establishment, is now purging itself.</p><p>At the same time, there's a growing cultural fixation on <em>the Epstein list</em>. The desire to expose powerful pedophiles is not only understandable — it’s justified. The crimes were real. The system is corrupt. But this obsession has taken on a talismanic quality. As if naming names might heal the wounds, as if the list might deliver justice that the courts cannot. As if uncovering elite depravity will resolve the collapsing social contract for everyone else.</p><p>But it's a distraction.</p><p>Because while America chants “who’s on the list,” real monsters continue to thrive in the shadows of everyday life — not just in elite compounds, but in suburban homes, shelters, and courtrooms.</p><p><strong>The epidemic of intimate partner violence continues to escalate.</strong> The economy continues to squeeze the most vulnerable. State violence, corporate theft, ecological collapse — these are not conspiracies. They are structured, visible, brutal facts.</p><p>And yet, conspiratorial fixation is safer than political transformation.<br>Easier to follow breadcrumbs into a rabbit hole than to follow your neighbor to a picket line or a city council meeting.<br>Easier to condemn traffickers on private islands than to confront the landlord who grooms and evicts vulnerable tenants.</p><p>The Ouroboros does not just represent eternity. It also represents <em>entrapment</em>.<br>It’s what happens when a movement, a country, or a culture consumes its own potential for justice — believing that exposure is enough, that naming and shaming can substitute for structural change.</p><p>Until we break the cycle, until we turn away from spectacle and toward solidarity, the serpent will keep devouring itself.</p><p><br>Not that solidarity alone will cut it. There is a deeper techno-determinist conspiracy playing out in front of our eyes. Whether crypto or AI, the scams are the same, and the game remains, power consolidation, and wealth concentration.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40oldeststories%2Fvideo%2F7524352756295961869&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@oldeststories/video/7524352756295961869&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;It occurs to me that AI science, due to the ontologically statistical nature of LLMs, is this but worse.
