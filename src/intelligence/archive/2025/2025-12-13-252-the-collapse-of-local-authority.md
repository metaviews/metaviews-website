Despite codes of conduct, integrity commissioners, and procedural safeguards, council has become ungovernable—not because rules are absent, but because they no longer work.</p><p>The strong-mayor reforms imposed by the province were meant to deliver decisiveness. Instead, they have accelerated institutional breakdown, revealing how fragile local democracy becomes when power outruns legitimacy and legislation is asked to do the work of politics.</p><p>Rideau Lakes is not a single town but a municipality composed of multiple communities, each with its own histories, interests, and expectations of representation. The municipal council exists precisely to mediate those differences. What has collapsed is not merely collegiality or decorum, but the shared authority necessary to govern across them. The council chamber has ceased to function as a place where conflict is resolved. It has become a site where conflict is escalated, proceduralized, and ultimately displaced.</p><p><strong>Strong Mayors and Weak Institutions</strong></p><p>Ontario’s strong-mayor system was sold as a corrective to indecisive local governance. Concentrated executive authority, the argument went, would cut through gridlock and deliver results. What this reform failed to account for was legitimacy. Power can be centralized by statute, but authority cannot.</p><p>In Rideau Lakes, the strong-mayor framework did not stabilize governance. It destabilized it. Once executive authority was enhanced without a corresponding strengthening of deliberative norms, oversight mechanisms were forced into a role they were never designed to play: containing political behavior that no longer recognizes institutional restraint.</p><p>Integrity commissioners, codes of conduct, and procedural sanctions are not tools for governing authoritarian tendencies. They are compliance instruments. They assume good faith. They presume a shared commitment to the institution itself. When that commitment erodes, enforcement becomes performative, punitive, and counterproductive.</p><p>As conflict intensified, council increasingly relied on administrative and legal mechanisms to restore order. Meetings were adjourned on safety grounds. In-person deliberation was suspended. Legal notices replaced dialogue. Each step was defensible in isolation. Together, they marked the end of politics.</p><p>This is a critical point. Democracies fail not only when rules are broken, but when rules are used to avoid resolving conflict. Once disagreement is reframed as a risk to be managed rather than a disagreement to be governed, authority retreats into process. The institution survives. Legitimacy does not.</p><p>Virtual meetings, legal counsel, and procedural discipline may preserve administrative continuity, but they hollow out the very function council is meant to serve: collective decision-making in the presence of disagreement.</p><p>Into this vacuum stepped the <a href="https://rlgrassroots.com/about">Rideau Lakes Grassroots Group</a>. Highly engaged, persistent, and rhetorically effective, the group positioned itself as a watchdog, a voice for residents, and a corrective to perceived institutional failure. In another context, this would be celebrated as democratic participation.</p><p>However the Grassroots Group does not simply participate in governance. It competes with it. By framing council decisions, amplifying conflict, and mobilizing public pressure outside formal channels, it became a parallel authority structure—one not accountable to institutional constraints, but capable of shaping legitimacy in real time.</p><p>When institutions are already weakened, citizen mobilization can accelerate collapse rather than renewal. Pressure without responsibility does not restore authority. It fragments it.</p><p>In Rideau Lakes, the grassroots did not cause the crisis. But it deepened it—turning governance disputes into legitimacy battles that no procedural mechanism could resolve.</p><p>The repeated use of Integrity Commissioner processes reveals the deeper failure. These mechanisms were meant to protect institutions from corruption, not to substitute for political leadership. Once they are deployed as primary tools of governance, authority has already failed.</p><p>Reprimands multiplied. Sanctions escalated. Yet nothing stabilized. Why? Because integrity enforcement cannot compel belief. It can only compel compliance—and compliance without legitimacy breeds resentment, defiance, and escalation.</p><p>This is the paradox at the heart of Rideau Lakes: the more rigorously the rules were enforced, the less authority they carried.</p><p>Local governments are where authority collapses first because they are closest to the public and weakest in institutional insulation. They are asked to absorb polarization, mistrust, and authoritarian tactics with tools designed for consensus and good faith. They cannot.</p><p>Rideau Lakes shows us what happens when rising authoritarian behavior meets a democratic system that believes legislation alone is sufficient to stop it. It is not.</p><p>The collapse of local authority in Rideau Lakes is not a failure of democracy in theory. It is a failure of democratic capacity in practice. We have built systems that can regulate behaviour but cannot govern power. We have encouraged participation without rebuilding legitimacy. We have centralized authority without renewing trust.</p><p>The canary in the council chamber is not warning us about one municipality. It is warning us about a political order that still believes rules can do the work of authority.</p><p>They cannot. </p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40eveparkerfinley%2Fvideo%2F7582981129024703752&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@eveparkerfinley/video/7582981129024703752&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;If we increase the speed that’s gonna increase the maintenance so keep em slow boys!! &quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/252-the-collapse-of-local-authority/08d32bee-872b-40d0-aa75-7caf5ecbfced_1080x1920-9aa7322b.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;eveparkerfinley&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40eveparkerfinley%2Fvideo%2F7582981129024703752&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@eveparkerfinley&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40eveparkerfinley%2Fvideo%2F7582981129024703752&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40eveparkerfinley%2Fvideo%2F7582981129024703752&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40eveparkerfinley%2Fvideo%2F7582981129024703752&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eveparkerfinley/video/7582981129024703752" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/252-the-collapse-of-local-authority/08d32bee-872b-40d0-aa75-7caf5ecbfced_1080x1920-9aa7322b.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Nldw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08d32bee-872b-40d0-aa75-7caf5ecbfced_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eveparkerfinley" target="_blank">@eveparkerfinley</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eveparkerfinley/video/7582981129024703752" target="_blank">If we increase the speed that’s gonna increase the maintenance so keep em slow boys!! </a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40eveparkerfinley%2Fvideo%2F7582981129024703752&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/252-the-collapse-of-local-authority/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
