It came with brunch, a fresh haircut, and a shrug: ‘I’m over it.’"</em></p></blockquote><p>COVID-19 has not just shaped the political landscape — it is <strong>driving it</strong>. What if the virus is not just background noise in the return to normal, but the <strong>fuel in fascism’s engine</strong>?</p><p><strong>COVID is the mechanism, medium, and metaphor for fascism’s rise</strong>, and we ignore it at our peril.</p><h3><strong>1. Asymptomatic Transmission: The Architecture of Denial</strong></h3><p>COVID is uniquely contagious because of its <strong>asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread</strong>. A virus that moves invisibly — with peak infectiousness before symptoms appear — creates a perfect environment for authoritarian denialism.</p><p>People carry the virus before they know it. They feel fine. They go to work. They post selfies. They say:</p><ul><li><p><em>“It’s just a cold.”</em></p></li><li><p><em>“We can’t live in fear.”</em></p></li><li><p><em>“We have to move on.”</em></p></li></ul><p>Fascism spreads the same way.</p><p>It doesn’t arrive with fanfare. It travels <strong>through influencers, coworkers, family dinners</strong>, and algorithmic feeds. It doesn’t declare “I am fascist!” — it whispers:</p><ul><li><p><em>“You’re being too sensitive.”</em></p></li><li><p><em>“Maybe we need stronger leadership.”</em></p></li><li><p><em>“Those people aren’t pulling their weight.”</em></p></li></ul><p>Like COVID, fascism is <strong>most contagious before you realize what’s happening</strong> — and by the time the symptoms show, it's already embedded in the culture.</p><h3><strong>2. Neuro-COVID: Priming the Mind for Control</strong></h3><p>SARS-CoV-2 causes <strong>neurological disruption</strong> — inflammation, brain fog, emotional dysregulation, fatigue. These effects can impair memory, attention, and critical thinking.</p><p>But what’s more dangerous is what this fog of war makes possible.</p><p>Infection doesn’t just make people sick — it <strong>makes them susceptible and vulnerable</strong>.</p><p>To easy answers. To strongmen. To scapegoats.</p><p>COVID primes society to accept authoritarian logic. It damages the parts of the brain that govern <strong>impulse control and complex reasoning</strong>, and it does so at scale. In a population where cognitive function is subtly impaired, the appeal of fascist messaging — clear, forceful, simple — increases.</p><p>This is not to say people are to blame for being infected. Rather, it's to recognize that <strong>repeated infections may neurologically condition populations to surrender discernment</strong>. It’s hard to think critically when you’re constantly tired, anxious, or confused.</p><p>And fascists thrive in that confusion.</p><h3><strong>3. Fascism as a COVID Management Strategy</strong></h3><p>To rule through COVID is to rule through <strong>eugenics</strong>.</p><ul><li><p>Let the vulnerable die.</p></li><li><p>Let the disabled become more disabled.</p></li><li><p>Let the working class be repeatedly infected until they’re no longer useful.</p></li></ul><p>This is not just indifference — it’s <strong>selection by policy</strong>. A quiet purification of the population under the guise of economic necessity and personal responsibility.</p><p>COVID becomes the tool by which states decide who is expendable and who gets access to clean air, rest, care, and survival. This is <strong>biopower weaponized</strong> — not with camps or commands, but with ventilation budgets, sick leave policies, and public messaging that erases risk.</p><h3><strong>4. AI and the Infrastructure of Forgetting</strong></h3><p>Artificial intelligence plays a silent but central role.</p><p>COVID taught the public to accept:</p><ul><li><p>Surveillance over solidarity</p></li><li><p>Metrics instead of medicine</p></li><li><p>Models over mutual care</p></li><li><p>Optimization over health</p></li></ul><p>Now AI is being used to automate that logic — to <strong>quantify productivity</strong>, <strong>enforce compliance</strong>, and <strong>standardize normalcy</strong>. It quietly classifies who is fit and who is not, who is essential and who is excess.</p><p>These systems don’t challenge fascism. They <strong>normalize it</strong>, encoding it into dashboards and predictive scores.</p><p>The techno-political infrastructure being built today is not neutral — it is <strong>trained on a pandemic response that values the economy over the body</strong>, and <strong>denial over disability</strong>.</p><h3><strong>5. The Pandemic Is the Policy</strong></h3><p>Letting COVID rip is not a failure of governance — it is governance.</p><p>It creates:</p><ul><li><p>A weakened workforce</p></li><li><p>A distracted public</p></li><li><p>A normalized death rate</p></li><li><p>A culture of disposable people</p></li></ul><p>And in that vacuum, fascism blooms — not because it has to fight for power, but because power has abandoned all alternatives.</p><p>This is why fighting fascism means fighting COVID. Not with slogans, but with systems:</p><ul><li><p>Masking in public spaces</p></li><li><p>Air purification as a public utility</p></li><li><p>Sick leave and disability support as democratic infrastructure</p></li><li><p>Collective refusal to “move on” when the crisis hasn’t ended</p></li></ul><h3><strong>6. COVID as a Carcinogen</strong></h3><p>COVID may not just disable or disrupt — it may <strong>plant seeds for future catastrophe</strong>.</p><p>Emerging science shows:</p><ul><li><p>The virus disrupts DNA repair pathways</p></li><li><p>It reactivates latent oncogenic viruses like EBV</p></li><li><p>It causes persistent inflammation, a known cancer driver</p></li><li><p>It impairs tumor-suppressor genes</p></li></ul><p>This means <strong>today’s mass infections may become tomorrow’s cancer epidemic</strong>.</p><p>We are breathing in a risk we barely understand. And those in power are choosing <strong>not to find out</strong> — because knowledge would mean accountability. Denial, on the other hand, means profit.</p><h3><strong>Fascism Is a Fever</strong></h3><p>The defining feature of this moment isn’t authoritarianism with a loudspeaker — it’s a <strong>quiet, chronic erosion</strong>, enabled by a virus we’ve been told to forget.</p><p>COVID is not just a health issue. It is the <strong>medium of control</strong>, the <strong>justification for abandonment</strong>, and the <strong>biological basis for a new hierarchy</strong>.</p><p>The fascists have figured this out. Have we?</p><p>Because if we’re serious about fighting fascism, we can’t just argue or organize. We have to <strong>mask up, filter air, support the sick</strong>, and confront the systems that chose to profit off our breath.</p><p>COVID is airborne. So is fascism.</p><p>So is the resistance.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cvdirty%2Fvideo%2F7529187228749139214&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@cvdirty/video/7529187228749139214&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;See it through my eyes.
