He is a political prisoner.</strong> And if Canada has any sense of dignity, sovereignty, or technological ambition, it will release him immediately—and refuse to hand him over to the United States.</p><p>Cottle, known online as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Cottle">@Kirtaner</a>, is a renowned hacktivist and early member of Anonymous. His so-called crimes? Exposing the Texas Republican Party’s vulnerabilities. Leaking donor data from GiveSendGo, the crowdfunding platform that bankrolled the far-right “Freedom Convoy.” Holding fascists accountable, not with violence, but with code.</p><h3>Hacktivism Is Civil Disobedience</h3><p>This isn’t about criminal activity. This is about political expression. Hacktivism is the digital equivalent of a sit-in, a street blockade, or a strategic leak. It’s a protest of last resort in an era where institutions insulate themselves from scrutiny and accountability.</p><p>We don’t criminalize hunger strikes. We don’t extradite whistleblowers to hostile regimes. Why should we treat hacktivists differently?</p><p>The answer is obvious: because their targets are powerful.</p><p>The United States has made clear that it sees itself as a global enforcer, entitled to detain, punish, and even execute those who challenge its power—regardless of nationality, borders, or democratic principle. The extradition request for Aubrey Cottle is part of that imperial logic.</p><p>Canada should reject it outright.</p><p>This is about more than one person. It’s about sovereignty. It’s about choosing whether we stand with digital dissenters or with the autocrats who fear them. If Canada wants to punch above its weight in global affairs, it must protect its cyber capacity—and the people who wield it in defense of democracy.</p><p>Aubrey Cottle is one of those people.</p><h3>Hackers Are Not the Problem. Insecure Institutions Are.</h3><p>Most hacks don’t steal. They don’t destroy. They expose. And that exposure often reveals shocking levels of incompetence, negligence, and corruption—especially from the very institutions demanding obedience.</p><p>We shouldn’t be asking whether Cottle broke the law. We should be asking why the Texas Republican Party’s website was so vulnerable in the first place. Why GiveSendGo—a crowdfunding platform built for right-wing extremism—was entrusted with sensitive donor data. Why these platforms weren’t regulated or secured before Cottle got there.</p><p><strong>Hackers are a mirror. What we see when we look into it is up to us.</strong></p><h3>The Political Prisoners of the Digital Age</h3><p>Cottle’s treatment mirrors that of other political prisoners like Julian Assange, and Chelsea Manning—fellow hacktivists persecuted for exposing sensitive political data. In each case, the state is not punishing violence or theft. It is punishing visibility.</p><p>Then there’s Luigi Mangione, who may be facing the death penalty, not so much for the crimes he is accused of, but their viral popularity on social media.</p><div class="embedded-post-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;id&quot;:160448177,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigi-mangione-becomes-a-political&quot;,&quot;publication_id&quot;:7677,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Ken Klippenstein&quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F356991b6-9095-402d-8a80-9f0b3873de6d_1280x1280.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Luigi Mangione Becomes A Political Prisoner&quot;,&quot;truncated_body_text&quot;:&quot;Luigi Mangione is now a political prisoner, with the federal government announcing its pursuit of the death penalty.

The idea was simple but revolutionary. Instead of waiting passively to be attacked, defenders should move proactively, identifying threats, misleading adversaries, and in some cases, taking the fight to them in cyberspace.</p><p>Today, that concept is no longer theoretical. The United States is threatening Canadian sovereignty, via a range of means, policy, culture, and potentially force.</p><p><strong>What if Canada embraced aggressive digital self-defense—not just as a technical framework, but as a political one?</strong></p><p>That would mean:</p><ul><li><p>Supporting <strong>independent hacktivists</strong> like Aubrey Cottle as frontline defenders, not outlaws.</p></li><li><p>Building a <strong>civilian cyber militia</strong> of white-hat hackers, decentralized and disruptive by design.</p></li><li><p>Developing and deploying <strong>active defense operations</strong> to counter foreign disinformation, economic espionage, and coercive diplomacy.</p></li><li><p>Institutionalizing cyber resistance as a <strong>pillar of national security</strong>, grounded in transparency, accountability, and democratic control.</p></li></ul><p>Hacktivism is not a threat—it’s a warning system. A force multiplier. A survival mechanism for democratic societies under siege.</p><p>Neil Wyler’s early warning was clear: the future of cybersecurity is proactive, not passive. Aubrey Cottle is living proof. Now the question is: will Canada choose to defend its networks, its people, and its future—or let Washington decide who gets locked up for seeking the truth?</p><p><strong>It’s time to stop playing defense.</strong><br></p><div id="youtube2-RyLlzHvXIDQ" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;RyLlzHvXIDQ&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RyLlzHvXIDQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div>
