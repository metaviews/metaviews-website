Sometimes it’s just the quiet disappearance of possibility.</p><p>At the core of any democratic society is a compact—not just about representation, but about participation. That <em>anyone</em> can run. That <em>anyone</em> could win. That power, however rare, is open to <em>you</em>.</p><p>It doesn’t matter that most people never run for office. Or that most people don’t want to. What matters is belief: the deeply social sense that, if things got bad enough or you felt called enough, you <em>could</em>. That the institutions are open. That the channels are clear. That the rules are fair.</p><p>When that belief falters, so does democracy. And when it collapses, democracy ends—<em>regardless</em> of whether elections continue.</p><p>This is the quiet exit ramp. Not a violent overthrow, but a slow evacuation of faith. The realization, by enough people, that the official route to power is closed to them. That it was never really open. That it belongs to someone else. Someone richer. Whiter. Safer. Smarter. Less “radical.” More “electable.”</p><p>And from that void, alternatives emerge. Not democratic alternatives—<em>anti</em>-democratic ones. Conspiracy. Populist authoritarianism. Crypto-oligarchy. Armed struggle. Or just resignation. Because if legitimate power is unavailable, then illegitimate power becomes the only option.</p><p>Democracy is not just a system of voting. It is a system of <em>power circulation</em>. It must have onramps—visible, working ones. If those onramps are broken, or hidden behind money and media, then power becomes fixed. And fixed power invites resistance, resentment, and rebellion.</p><p>In the U.S., this is visible in the rise of extremist politics—both in populist MAGA-style movements, and in accelerationist leftist tendencies. In Canada, the absence of real pathways to power for working-class people, Indigenous leaders, and youth creates a vacuum that demagogues and technocrats fill.</p><p>If you are a nurse or a warehouse worker or a student saddled with debt, what does the path to power look like to you? Who do you see on the ballot that looks or sounds like you? If politics feels like a club, and the door is locked, then whatever’s outside becomes more attractive—no matter how dangerous.</p><p>Most political elites assume that elections are enough. That procedure equals legitimacy. But procedure without <em>access</em> is performance. It becomes theater—sometimes comedy, often tragedy.</p><p>Once people believe the system is rigged or unreachable, they begin to act accordingly. They tune out. Or they lash out. They begin to prefer symbolic gestures to structural reform. They turn to influencers instead of institutions. They look for strength, not justice. For vengeance, not balance.</p><p>We saw this in Trumpism, but it’s not limited to the right. The collapse of belief in accessible power leads to all kinds of radicalism—some generative, much of it reactive. Occupy. Jan 6. The Freedom Convoy. The Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. These are not equivalents in ideology, but they <em>are</em> equivalents in sentiment: a loss of faith in official channels.</p><h3>Who Keeps the Door Open?</h3><p>To defend democracy, we must ensure the path to power remains open, visible, and credible. That means:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Campaign finance reform</strong>: If you need millions to run, you don’t live in a democracy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Media democratization</strong>: If your story can’t be heard, you can’t compete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Civic education</strong>: People need to know how power works to believe they can wield it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Proportional representation</strong>: So votes count, and new voices can win.</p></li><li><p><strong>Affirmative pathways for marginalized leaders</strong>: Because representation is nothing without access.</p></li></ul><p>But more than any reform, we need to restore belief. Because once people stop believing, they stop participating—and democracy is a formality wrapped around oligarchy.</p><p>Elites often claim the system is open to all. But meritocracy, as constructed, is a lie. It's a sorting mechanism for privilege. The real gatekeeping happens upstream—who gets access, who has time, who builds networks, who is safe enough, housed enough, fluent enough to run.</p><p>We don’t need to flatten power entirely. But we do need to <em>restructure</em> it so that people can believe, without delusion, that power is not a locked room.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40iamcreo_%2Fvideo%2F7516540215893314872&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@iamcreo_/video/7516540215893314872&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Jagmeet Singh. please get it together #ndp #cdnpoli #rant  &quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/205-the-path-to-power-is-the-soul-of-democracy/96eb764b-0809-4a89-93ff-fc25e7cb3375_1080x1920-5d198c16.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;creo 🖤🍉&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40iamcreo_%2Fvideo%2F7516540215893314872&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@iamcreo_&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40iamcreo_%2Fvideo%2F7516540215893314872&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40iamcreo_%2Fvideo%2F7516540215893314872&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40iamcreo_%2Fvideo%2F7516540215893314872&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@iamcreo_/video/7516540215893314872" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/205-the-path-to-power-is-the-soul-of-democracy/96eb764b-0809-4a89-93ff-fc25e7cb3375_1080x1920-5d198c16.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6XXH!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F96eb764b-0809-4a89-93ff-fc25e7cb3375_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@iamcreo_" target="_blank">@iamcreo_</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@iamcreo_/video/7516540215893314872" target="_blank">Jagmeet Singh. please get it together #ndp #cdnpoli #rant  </a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40iamcreo_%2Fvideo%2F7516540215893314872&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/205-the-path-to-power-is-the-soul-of-democracy/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
