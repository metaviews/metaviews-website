The plan? To forcibly relocate Gaza’s Palestinian population to neighboring countries, rebuild the territory as a Middle Eastern “Riviera,” and deploy U.S. military forces to make it happen. The backlash was immediate and ferocious, yet the proposal itself speaks to a deeper crisis—one that threatens to unravel the post-World War II order built on international law, and human rights.</p><p>Trump’s announcement is both shocking and entirely consistent with his worldview. His administration has long disregarded diplomatic norms, preferring bold, disruptive gestures over painstaking diplomacy. This latest gambit, however, carries implications that extend far beyond Gaza.</p><p>Critics from across the spectrum have condemned the plan:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ethnic Cleansing:</strong> International legal scholars have called the proposed displacement of Palestinians a violation of international law, amounting to ethnic cleansing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Destabilization of the Middle East:</strong> Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia have all rejected the proposal outright, refusing to accept any displaced Palestinian population.</p></li><li><p><strong>A Return to Imperial Occupation?</strong> Even U.S. lawmakers, normally deferential to Israel, have voiced concerns that this would amount to an American military occupation of Gaza, with all the bloodshed and instability that entails.</p></li><li><p><strong>Geopolitical Consequences:</strong> The European Union, the United Nations, and various human rights organizations have condemned the proposal, signaling a potential diplomatic crisis between the U.S. and its allies.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>The End of the Post-WWII Order?</strong></h3><p>For decades, international law—though imperfect—served as a framework to mediate conflict and restrain raw power politics. The postwar consensus was built on the idea that atrocities like forced displacement should never happen again. Yet, Trump’s proposal signals something more profound: a return to a pre-World War I model of international relations, where power alone dictates legitimacy.</p><p>This is not just about Trump. The decline of international institutions, the erosion of human rights norms, and the increasing militarization of global politics all suggest that the postwar legal order is collapsing. If the world accepts the U.S. claim over Gaza, what stops other nations from following suit elsewhere? Are we witnessing the normalization of conquest in the 21st century?</p><h3><strong>Palestine as a Symbol for the Future of Authority</strong></h3><p>The plight of Palestinians has always been about more than geography. It is a test case for the global order—whether human rights and self-determination still matter, or whether might truly makes right.</p><p>The suppression of Palestinian voices in mainstream media only deepens this crisis. We need more Palestinian perspectives, more honest discussion, and a recognition that what happens in Gaza is not just about the Middle East—it is about the very future of authority itself.</p><p>A world that allows Gaza to be turned into an American protectorate is a world where any nation, at any time, can justify conquest. We must reject that world and fight for one where justice, not power, is the final word.</p><p>We talked about this and more on episode 3 of the <a href="https://red-tory.com">Red-Tory podcast</a> (audio version available via your favourite podcast platform):</p><div id="youtube2-Ym-sGXtnV6E" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Ym-sGXtnV6E&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ym-sGXtnV6E?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div>
