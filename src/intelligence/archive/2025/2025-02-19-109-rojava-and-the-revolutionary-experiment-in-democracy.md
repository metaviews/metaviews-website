In the vast stretches of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria">Rojava</a>, where the desert meets the mountains, a society is defying the conventions of statehood, capitalism, and patriarchy. Here, in the face of relentless war and blockade, people are proving that another world is possible.</p><p>Born out of necessity and guided by revolutionary ideals, Rojava’s democratic experiment is unlike anything seen in the modern Middle East. It is a society where decisions are made not by distant politicians but by neighborhood assemblies; where women take up arms, not just for protection, but for liberation; where a shattered economy is rebuilt not by corporate investors but by cooperative labor. This is not a utopia—it is a struggle, a living revolution shaped by the pressures of war and survival.</p><p>At the heart of Rojava’s political system is Democratic Confederalism, a philosophy developed by Abdullah Öcalan, the imprisoned Kurdish leader. The movement rejects the nation-state model, instead embracing a network of communes and councils, where power flows from the bottom up. It is a model that prioritizes direct democracy, ecological sustainability, and pluralism, offering a stark contrast to the authoritarian regimes that once surrounded it. In towns and villages once controlled by the Syrian state, Kurds, Arabs, and Assyrians are now building a society that values inclusivity over identity politics.</p><p>This radical social transformation is perhaps most evident in the role of women. In a region where patriarchal oppression has long been the norm, Rojava’s revolution places gender equality at the center of its governance. Women co-chair councils, lead their own military units, and run academies that challenge traditional gender roles. The Women’s Protection Units (YPJ), formed as a response to the threat of ISIS, have become symbols of both defiance and possibility. Their struggle is not just against armed enemies, but against centuries of structural oppression.</p><p>But revolution is more than just governance; it is the way people live their daily lives. Rojava’s economy, shaped by war and embargo, operates on principles of self-sufficiency and cooperation. Where private enterprise once dictated the flow of goods, now cooperatives determine production, ensuring that resources are shared rather than hoarded. It is a fragile system, constantly tested by external forces. Turkey’s military incursions, ongoing economic strangulation, and shifting international alliances place immense pressure on this fledgling society.</p><p>Education, too, is undergoing transformation. Schools teach in Kurdish, Arabic, and Syriac, undoing decades of forced linguistic assimilation. Instead of rote memorization, children are taught to question, to participate, to see themselves as part of a collective struggle. Women’s academies, modeled on the teachings of radical educators like Paulo Freire, serve not just as institutions of learning but as training grounds for liberation.</p><p>Yet, despite its achievements, Rojava remains in peril. Turkey views the region as an extension of the PKK and continues its assaults on Kurdish-held territories. With the fall of the Assad regime, new regional power struggles are emerging, and the fate of Rojava remains uncertain. The withdrawal of U.S. support has left Rojava increasingly isolated. In al-Hol camp, where tens of thousands of ISIS-linked detainees remain, a humanitarian crisis is deepening.</p><div class="bluesky-wrap outer" style="height: auto; display: flex; margin-bottom: 24px;" data-attrs="{&quot;postId&quot;:&quot;3lgjjkjjgpc27&quot;,&quot;authorDid&quot;:&quot;did:plc:jow32egkls4neachb2kjabhh&quot;,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;authorHandle&quot;:&quot;semiotext.bsky.social&quot;,&quot;authorAvatarUrl&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.bsky.app/img/avatar/plain/did:plc:jow32egkls4neachb2kjabhh/bafkreigkwxc6ww53tdfc5wo7devjteddnwdqb74t2osd2nuwbtvksqbusq@jpeg&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Botha primer and an update.

But the revolution here has already changed what people believe is possible. It has shown that even under siege, even amid war, an alternative to the state can be built. For those who dream of a different world, Rojava stands as a testament—not to an abstract ideal, but to a lived reality.</p><p>For those who want to learn more, the <a href="https://rojavainformationcenter.com/">Rojava Information Center</a> provides in-depth analysis on developments in the region. Organizations like <a href="https://makerojavagreenagain.org/">Make Rojava Green Again</a> and <a href="https://kurdishsolidaritynetwork.wordpress.com/">Kurdish Solidarity Network</a> offer ways to support the struggle. The revolution in Rojava is ongoing, and its lessons—both its triumphs and its hardships—demand our attention.</p><div id="youtube2-PTawGdIdkjM" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;PTawGdIdkjM&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PTawGdIdkjM?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div>
