But there's another, less obvious dimension to this unfolding coup: the financial restructuring of the American Empire. While Trump works to dismantle democratic constraints on the presidency, Elon Musk is executing a parallel plan—to seize the power of spending from Congress by literally taking over the computers that issue payments.</p><p>This connects directly to the secondary focus of the Trump Coup: replacing the US dollar with cryptocurrency.</p><p>On the surface, their actions appear to be sabotaging the US government, the US economy, and by extension, the credibility of the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. But this is not merely a reckless byproduct of their authoritarian ambitions, nor is it an attempt to empower an emerging BRICS alternative. Instead, they are actively engineering the collapse of the dollar to replace it with something else: Bitcoin.</p><p>Unlike the US dollar—widely held by governments, institutions, and citizens around the world—Bitcoin is not a currency that can be printed by democratic governments through democratic policies. Instead, it is finite, rigid, and entirely outside of public control. The implications of such a shift cannot be overstated.</p><p>The global distribution of US dollars is broad, with countries like Japan and China holding significant reserves. Bitcoin, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357196737_Characterizing_Wealth_Inequality_in_Cryptocurrencies">is concentrated in the hands of a few</a>, where wealth disparity is exponentially worse than what exists in the traditional financial system. Concerned about Wall Street billionaires manipulating the economy? The Bitcoin whales, will make the old oligarchs look quaint.</p><p>Trump could default on US dollar denominated debt. Wipe the slate clean.</p><p>The price of Bitcoin is irrelevant. What matters is who owns large amounts. These coins are already owned, and the volatility of the crypto markets makes it easy for those in it for the long term to fleece new suckers.</p><p>Trump’s recent Executive Order 14178, titled <em>Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology</em>, underscores this agenda. The order explicitly prohibits federal agencies from establishing, issuing, or promoting a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), effectively ensuring that the U.S. government cannot offer a publicly controlled alternative to Bitcoin or other private cryptocurrencies. The order also revokes prior policies aimed at regulating digital assets, favoring a laissez-faire environment where crypto billionaires can dictate the financial landscape. The creation of a <em>Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets</em>, chaired by Silicon Valley power player David Sacks, further cements the shift toward a privately controlled financial future.</p><p>Here’s the key: Musk, Thiel, Zuckerberg, Bezos, and the other members of the Broligarchy stand to gain unprecedented wealth and power. They were there when Bitcoin was worth pennies if not dollars. As was Metaviews! Here’s a video we made in June of 2011 when BTC was first spiking to $30:</p><div id="youtube2-Br5UrV20nIk" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Br5UrV20nIk&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Br5UrV20nIk?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>Many tech bros bought in then, or shortly thereafter. In a US dollar-based economy, they are billionaires. In a Bitcoin economy, they become trillionaires.</p><p>If their economic agenda is truly the engine of this coup, then we must rethink the trajectory of American imperial power. It is not the US economy or the US dollar they intend to preserve—it is their own wealth, concentrated within a digital currency immune to democratic interference.</p><p>What happens when a financial system transitions from state-backed fiat currency to privately controlled digital money? Who controls the global economy when wealth is no longer issued by governments but instead mined and hoarded by tech oligarchs?</p><p>This is not just a shift in currency; it is a shift in sovereignty. The question is whether we will accept this transition or fight for an alternative future.</p><p><a href="https://red-tory.com">Red-Tory</a> is now on the air!
