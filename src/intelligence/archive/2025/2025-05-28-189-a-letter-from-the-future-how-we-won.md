Not just because it was frightening—but because it was familiar. We’ve spent generations studying how your world almost collapsed, how so many turned to fantasy and fury instead of each other. And how, against all odds, some of you chose a different path.</p><p>You were told the world was too complex to fix. That your voice no longer mattered. That you should cling to certainty, even if it was cruel.</p><p>We know what it felt like.</p><p>We remember the headlines that contradicted each other. The leaders who spoke in riddles and rage. The algorithms that gave you enemies instead of answers. The temptation to retreat into simple stories, to accept blame instead of responsibility, to confuse punishment for justice.</p><p>We remember how fascism didn't march in with uniforms—but arrived instead through podcasts, parents, school boards, and suggestion feeds. It promised to make sense of the chaos. It said: “You’re not confused—you’re being betrayed. You’re not powerless—you’re chosen. Follow us.”</p><p>And many did.</p><p>But some of you resisted—not with violence or slogans, but with questions. With care. With curiosity. With community.</p><p>You began asking: <em>What if the problem isn’t that the world is broken, but that we’ve been taught to see it in pieces?</em></p><p>You stopped trying to win arguments and started building trust.</p><p>You created open schools, where learning wasn’t standardized but social. You built networks that weren’t extractive but reciprocal. You rediscovered what it meant to make sense together—not to flatten the world into binaries, but to hold its contradictions with care.</p><p>You stopped pretending everything needed to be explained, and instead focused on what needed to be <em>shared</em>.</p><p>That was the beginning.</p><p>It didn’t happen on a debate stage. It happened at libraries, community kitchens, co-ops, clinics, church basements, discord servers, pirate radio stations, and among the ruins of broken institutions.</p><p>We call it the <em>Great Listening</em>. It was messy. Unprofitable. And unbearably slow.</p><p>But it worked.</p><p>You didn’t fight fascism with facts. You made it irrelevant by building meaning elsewhere. You didn’t convince everyone. But you didn’t need to.</p><p>You made better stories. You offered real belonging. You modeled care.</p><p>And once people had access to that? The fantasy stopped being so seductive.</p><p>We’re not writing to thank you—we’re writing to remind you. That you still have time. That your work is not in vain. That we are here, on the other side, because someone like you refused the easy answer and chose the hard work of collective truth.</p><p>History will not save you. But solidarity might.</p><p>With gratitude from the world you made possible,<br>—The Future</p><p><strong>[End Transmission]</strong></p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40pacoonpause%2Fvideo%2F7508472144632843526&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@pacoonpause/video/7508472144632843526&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;I'm surprised that so many leftists threw in the towel with masking.&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/189-a-letter-from-the-future-how-we-won/827f9a95-914f-48a3-8937-f361647c61b3_1080x1920-b853811a.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;PacoOnPause&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40pacoonpause%2Fvideo%2F7508472144632843526&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@pacoonpause&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40pacoonpause%2Fvideo%2F7508472144632843526&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40pacoonpause%2Fvideo%2F7508472144632843526&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40pacoonpause%2Fvideo%2F7508472144632843526&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pacoonpause/video/7508472144632843526" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/189-a-letter-from-the-future-how-we-won/827f9a95-914f-48a3-8937-f361647c61b3_1080x1920-b853811a.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_Lri!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F827f9a95-914f-48a3-8937-f361647c61b3_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pacoonpause" target="_blank">@pacoonpause</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pacoonpause/video/7508472144632843526" target="_blank">I'm surprised that so many leftists threw in the towel with masking.</a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40pacoonpause%2Fvideo%2F7508472144632843526&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/189-a-letter-from-the-future-how-we-won/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
