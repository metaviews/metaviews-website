There were two primary reasons why we ceased publishing on substack.</p><p>The first was feeling completely overrun and surrounded by the stupid conspiratorial covid narratives. In hindsight it is painfully clear to recognize that the conspiracists won the information war of the pandemic and this is a big reason the pandemic continues, despite your best efforts to ignore it.</p><p>The second was recognizing that substack was infested and overrun by nazi scum. A few years later this hasn’t changed, but unfortunately the rest of society has, as it too is kinda infested and overrun by nazi scum. While that may appear as an exaggerative sentence, any presence of these scum whatsoever is a potential symptom of infestation, and if not responded to promptly, will result in being overrun.</p><p>Similarly, like covid, it feels as if the public narratives are inherently corrupted by conspiratorial thinking and willful ignorance. This publication is designed to dissect and decipher the future of authority from the narratives we find ourselves exploring. Yet at this moment that feels futile, and while we employ an inherently surrealist method, we feel that our culture has moved beyond the surreal.</p><p>Literally, we’re meshuga from all the meshugaas.</p><p>So what does this mean? Well, clearly we’re taking a moment to assess what the fuck is up. At this point, that does not mean the end of this publication. However it does mean we need time to find an approach to this narrative nonsense that somehow doesn’t contribute further to the nonsense.</p><p>Not an easy task, and if there’s anyone you see out there attempting  or even accomplishing this, let us know.</p><p>In the meantime, you’re welcome to enjoy this presentation in the future of agriculture in Ontario. We’ve been told that it’s quite entertaining and informative:</p><div id="youtube2-ezkuh7fHQrM" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;ezkuh7fHQrM&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ezkuh7fHQrM?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div>
