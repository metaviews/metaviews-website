I was on ramp call‑out at San Antonio International, clipboard in one hand, orange wands in the other, trying not to think about the charter on the remote stand.</p><p>Everybody on night shift knows those flights. No logos. No airline livery. Men in self‑bought tactical gear with scarves up over their faces, rifles slung, radios clipped to their shoulders. They roll vans right to the stairs and hustle people up before the sun’s high enough for the news to see. We’re told not to look. We look anyway.</p><p>The terminal inside was waking up—families with sleepy kids, business travelers performing calm. I cut through baggage to grab a coffee, and that’s when the boards started to stutter. Not a full takeover—more like a hiccup that left a bruise. Departures blinked and came back with fragments where the times should be:</p><p>NO HUMAN IS ILLEGAL<br>DON’T DEPORT FUTURES<br>GROUND THE FLIGHT</p><p>People squinted, then laughed it off as a glitch. TSA frowned. Ops radio traffic went sharp: “Anyone else seeing that?”</p><p>She was leaning on a column a few feet from me like she’d wandered in with everyone else. No rush. No sign. Just a canvas tote and a habit of seeing the whole room. I recognized nothing specific and everything at once—an ease around pressure, that stillness like she was already somewhere else in her head, moving pieces I couldn’t see.</p><p>The boards steadied. She was gone. I figured I’d imagined her.</p><p>Downstairs, the carousels coughed and choked. Luggage thumped onto the belt with a clatter of plastic bins and roller bags… and then a sheet of fabric slid out like a tongue: GROUND THE FLIGHT, stenciled in black. Another banner followed, then another, riding the belt between Samsonites while two agents tried to grab them without making a scene. A kid in a Spidey hoodie shouted, “It’s like the DC thing!” His mom pulled him close, eyes on the ceiling cameras.</p><p>From the atrium, a trumpet cracked open the morning. One brassy note, then a second voice on trombone, sloppy and perfect in the echo of glass and tile. Travelers drifted toward the sound the way you drift toward a kitchen when you smell bread. Phones came up. A livestream notification pinged on my own. Chat scrolling: is this her? this feels like her.</p><p>I stepped out onto the service road to get a look at the remote stand. Runway edge lights blinked a pattern I’ve only ever seen in drills—one taxiway closed, then another, rerouting traffic in a lazy S that forced the charter’s tug to sit and wait, bathed in green and blue. Out by the fence, a security gate jammed all the way open. Not broken—open. Families, bleary from red‑eyes and layovers, had wandered past the line without realizing, pooling in a no‑man’s‑land where you could see what you were never supposed to see: the masks, the rifles, the quick hands on someone’s elbows as they hustled them up the airstairs.</p><p>Murmurs turned to a low current. “That banner—Memphis had banners.” “No, this is like El Paso—she blocked whole blocks.” “I saw the stream from DC—remember the music?” No one agreed. Everyone recognized the feeling.</p><p>On the ramp, one of the masked men barked into a radio. Another raised a hand to shield his face from a dozen phones. The brass in the atrium pushed louder, faster, a ragged march that found a pocket in your chest and kicked. The carousel belts seized and spat another canvas tongue. TSA tried to herd curious travelers back inside the lines, but the lines had blurred.</p><p>Ops burned my ear: “Remote stand two five is holding—repeat, holding. Maintain position, do not approach.”</p><p>I watched the minutes stack up like chocks under a nosewheel. Charter pilots don’t like minutes. Lawyers love them.</p><p>Someone killed the concourse lights for thirty heartbeats. Not a full blackout—just a deep blink that turned the airport to a held breath. Gasps, a child’s laugh, the hiss of radios. When the fluorescents snapped back, the brass had vanished. Banners gone. Carousels clean. The flight boards wore their usual lies again.</p><p>Out on the tarmac, the charter stairs were still down. The vans were idling hard. A pair of suits I’d never seen before walked briskly toward the security gate with a folder and a frown.</p><p>By the time the sun finally burned the edges of the clouds pink, the charter hadn’t moved. Word came down soft and sideways: “Stand’s released.” Which means the flight didn’t leave. Which means someone got time they weren’t supposed to have.</p><p>I climbed back into the tug, heart doing its own pushback. Taped under the clamp on my clipboard was a folded scrap the size of a baggage tag. Block letters, written quick like always.</p><p><em>“Airports are borders. Borders are prisons. A grounded flight is a free breath.”</em></p><p>I tucked it under the plastic sleeve and went to marshal a 737 into gate B9 like I wasn’t still listening to the echo of brass in a building designed to muffle everything that matters.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cole.notcole%2Fvideo%2F7539767466839330055&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@cole.notcole/video/7539767466839330055&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;#aircanada #strike #workersrights #canada&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/235-airports-are-borders-borders-are-prisons/f5e92044-f943-47c4-82a5-2e21b94456fe_1080x1920-30f65de2.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Ig: COLE.NOTCOLE 🇨🇦&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cole.notcole%2Fvideo%2F7539767466839330055&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@cole.notcole&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cole.notcole%2Fvideo%2F7539767466839330055&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cole.notcole%2Fvideo%2F7539767466839330055&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cole.notcole%2Fvideo%2F7539767466839330055&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cole.notcole/video/7539767466839330055" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/235-airports-are-borders-borders-are-prisons/f5e92044-f943-47c4-82a5-2e21b94456fe_1080x1920-30f65de2.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I7JJ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5e92044-f943-47c4-82a5-2e21b94456fe_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cole.notcole" target="_blank">@cole.notcole</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cole.notcole/video/7539767466839330055" target="_blank">#aircanada #strike #workersrights #canada</a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cole.notcole%2Fvideo%2F7539767466839330055&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/235-airports-are-borders-borders-are-prisons/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
