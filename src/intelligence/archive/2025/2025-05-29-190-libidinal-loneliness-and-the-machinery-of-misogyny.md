Erotic dislocation. Recursive resentment. Terminal irony.<br><strong>Intake Summary:</strong> Self-referred after prolonged participation in online communities organized around perceived romantic exclusion and social grievance.</p><blockquote><p>“I just want someone to love me.”<br>—Subject, first session.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><h2>I. <strong>The Surrogate Relationship</strong></h2><p>From the beginning, it was clear that JBP didn’t simply want romance—he wanted confirmation. A sign that he mattered. A signal that he was not invisible.</p><p>He wanted to be <em>wanted</em>. But rather than seek connection, he turned to the forums.</p><p>And the forums welcomed him. Not warmly, but <em>familiarly</em>. They knew his pain before he could articulate it. They mirrored his frustration. They gave it grammar and myth.</p><p>It was here that the real bond formed—not with women, but with the <em>movement itself</em>. It gave JBP a role to play. A shared language. A story.</p><p>Like any relationship, it had rituals: memes, rankings, initiation rites. And like any toxic relationship, it offered comfort <em>on the condition of loyalty</em>.</p><h2>II. <strong>Desire and the Fantasy of Lack</strong></h2><p>Drawing on Lacan, desire is not about having—it’s about <em>lacking</em>. It is structured around what is missing, not what is possessed.</p><p>JBP didn’t desire women so much as he desired <em>being desired by them</em>. It was the fantasy of being the object of affection—not the reality—that defined his worldview.</p><p>This is why women, for JBP, were never quite real. They were abstract projections: “foids,” “Stacys,” placeholders for what he was denied.</p><p>They functioned like ghosts in a psychic drama, haunting his screen and thoughts—not as individuals, but as <em>the gatekeepers of his self-worth</em>.</p><p>And standing beside them were “Chads”—the phallic ideal. Not just competition, but evidence of his own perceived failure.</p><p>He did not hate them because they had more. He hated them because they proved he <em>lacked</em>.</p><h2>III. <strong>Resentment as Intimacy</strong></h2><p>One of the breakthroughs came when I asked: “Do you feel worse or better after time on the forums?”</p><p>“Worse,” he said without hesitation. “But at least it’s real.”</p><p>This is the paradox that Lauren Berlant called <em>cruel optimism</em>—remaining attached to something that prevents you from getting what you actually want.</p><p>The incel community didn’t give JBP love, but it gave him <em>structure</em>. It turned loneliness into identity. Pain into ritual. Suffering into status.</p><p>Within the group, emotional breakdown became a badge of authenticity. Rage became a kind of intimacy. Victimhood became valor.</p><p>And in this way, the community <em>became the object of his love</em>. It held him in its cold embrace and said, “Only we understand you.”</p><p>He believed it.</p><h2>IV. <strong>The Algorithmic Arms of the Lover</strong></h2><p>None of this is accidental.</p><p>What we call inceldom is not a natural outgrowth of male loneliness—it’s an <em>engineered affective state</em>. The algorithms reinforce outrage, reward confession, and bind users into tighter and tighter circles of grievance.</p><p>Byung-Chul Han describes this as the “smooth violence” of digital society. Everything appears frictionless, participatory, and expressive. But it flattens affect, isolates users, and replaces real contact with curated hostility.</p><p>For JBP, the incel movement didn’t just listen—it <em>responded</em>. Not with empathy, but with emotional resonance. It always had something to say. Always had a new post. A new theory. A new reason why the world owed him something.</p><h2>V. <strong>The Case of the Dream</strong></h2><p>One of JBP’s final sessions was marked by a dream he couldn’t stop describing:</p><blockquote><p>“It’s like I’m in a high school gym on prom night. The lights are on, but it’s empty. And then I hear a voice. It says: ‘They’ll never love you like I do.’ It’s not a person—it’s the forum. I start crying. But I feel… safe.”</p></blockquote><p>This was the key insight.</p><p>JBP was not searching for love. He had <em>found</em> it—in the cold code of community resentment. It didn’t touch him physically. It didn’t challenge him emotionally. But it held him. Validated him. Gave him meaning.</p><p>He wasn’t addicted to rejection. He was addicted to the emotional <em>clarity</em> of knowing he would never be accepted.</p><p>That certainty felt like love.</p><h2>VI. <strong>The Culture That Made Him</strong></h2><p>This case is not about one man. JBP is not an anomaly. He is a product of a world where intimacy is commercialized, masculinity is in crisis, and desire is engineered.</p><p>Mark Fisher described this as <em>reflexive impotence</em>: knowing the system is rigged, and yet feeling too powerless to change it.</p><p>JBP was stuck between two impossibilities: the impossibility of being loved, and the impossibility of leaving the one thing that <em>acted like love</em>.</p><p>He was not radicalized. He was <em>seduced</em>.</p><h2>VII. <strong>Therapeutic Recommendations</strong></h2><p>If we’re serious about dismantling the incel movement, we need to stop treating it as a fringe ideology and start seeing it as a <em>relationship</em>. One that’s abusive, yes—but also fulfilling emotional needs unmet by society.</p><p>We cannot simply ban content or shut down platforms. We must ask:</p><blockquote><p>What does the movement provide?<br>And how can we offer better alternatives?</p></blockquote><p>We need new spaces for masculine tenderness. New rituals of belonging. New collective structures of affection.</p><p>Because if JBP was in love with a machine, it’s only because the machine loved him back—in all the wrong ways.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>End of File.</strong><br><strong>Status:</strong> Patient ongoing.<br><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Treat the culture, not just the symptom.</p><div id="youtube2-qEctZxEmuwU" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;qEctZxEmuwU&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qEctZxEmuwU?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div>
