During his campaign, Donald Trump shrewdly weaponized the rising price of eggs as a symbol of economic pressure felt acutely by working-class and poor Americans. It was a message that resonated. But now, as his administration flexes the power of the state in ways that actively undermine food security, it’s clear that the real cost of Trumpism may be measured in empty stomachs and growing unrest.</p><p>Let’s break down the three crises converging on America’s food system and the chaos they threaten to unleash.</p><h3>1. <strong>The Labor Crisis in Agriculture</strong></h3><p>The backbone of North America’s food production is immigrant labor. From fruit-picking to livestock care, the food we eat is often brought to our tables by workers who lack formal status. But under Trump’s revived deportation machine, this invisible workforce is disappearing fast.</p><p>Reports from California—a state responsible for a significant share of the continent’s fruits, vegetables, and nuts—indicate farms experiencing up to <strong>75% absenteeism</strong>. Anticipated ICE raids, coupled with fear of deportation, are pushing workers underground or out of the country entirely. This labor vacuum spells disaster. Without these workers, crops rot in fields, food prices soar, and supply chains teeter on the edge of collapse.</p><p>The Trump administration’s immigration policies, pitched as a strategy to restore "law and order," are instead destabilizing a critical sector of the economy. In California alone, the ripple effects could devastate not just farmers and consumers but the fragile trust that holds the system together.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40cagovernor%2Fvideo%2F7447293071521238318&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@cagovernor/video/7447293071521238318&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;This is serious business.

The disease has already taken a significant toll on poultry farms, driving up the price of eggs and meat. And yet, instead of mobilizing resources to address this emerging crisis, Trump’s government has opted for catastrophic isolationism.</p><p>By withdrawing from the World Health Organization (WHO) and gutting domestic public health measures, the administration is leaving the United States vulnerable to a pathogen that doesn’t respect borders. This is more than negligence—it’s creating the perfect conditions for the mutation and spread of a virus that could wreak havoc on the food supply chain.</p><p>Eggs, a staple protein source for millions of Americans, have already become symbolic of the affordability crisis. But if avian flu continues unchecked, we could be looking at shortages that hit the poorest households hardest, deepening inequality and exacerbating unrest.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40yaboihatestiktok%2Fvideo%2F7463974754450459935&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@yaboihatestiktok/video/7463974754450459935&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Wait…… I thought the prices of eggs and gas were going to drop?! 😂🤣 #priceofeggs #eggs #eggprices #dumptrump #fdt &quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/88-farm-labor-prison-labor-and-food-insecurity/05ef1d92-9c36-42a5-998f-1e591d9e0f64_1186x1701-bf83fc5a.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;YaBoiHatesTikTok&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40yaboihatestiktok%2Fvideo%2F7463974754450459935&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@yaboihatestiktok&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40yaboihatestiktok%2Fvideo%2F7463974754450459935&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40yaboihatestiktok%2Fvideo%2F7463974754450459935&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40yaboihatestiktok%2Fvideo%2F7463974754450459935&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yaboihatestiktok/video/7463974754450459935" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/88-farm-labor-prison-labor-and-food-insecurity/05ef1d92-9c36-42a5-998f-1e591d9e0f64_1186x1701-bf83fc5a.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!sl3-!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F05ef1d92-9c36-42a5-998f-1e591d9e0f64_1186x1701.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yaboihatestiktok" target="_blank">@yaboihatestiktok</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yaboihatestiktok/video/7463974754450459935" target="_blank">Wait…… I thought the prices of eggs and gas were going to drop?! 😂🤣 #priceofeggs #eggs #eggprices #dumptrump #fdt </a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40yaboihatestiktok%2Fvideo%2F7463974754450459935&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/88-farm-labor-prison-labor-and-food-insecurity/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div><h3>3. <strong>The Hidden Agenda: Profiting from Crisis</strong></h3><p>Behind the tough-on-immigration rhetoric lies a darker truth: the privatization of human suffering. Public resources for detention and deportation are stretched to their limits, yet the administration continues to funnel people into a sprawling system of private detention facilities. These prisons, operated by for-profit corporations, thrive on bodies and misery.</p><p>And it doesn’t stop there. As immigrant labor in agriculture becomes scarcer, the temptation to turn to <strong>prison labor</strong> looms large. In fact, it’s already happening. California has used prison labor for years to fight wildfires—paying incarcerated workers less than $2 an hour. The idea of replacing migrant farmworkers with incarcerated individuals isn’t just plausible; it’s disturbingly likely.</p><p>This system of legalized slavery mirrors America’s darkest chapters, where Black and Brown bodies were commodified for profit. Now, under the guise of law enforcement, the prison-industrial complex is poised to insert itself into agriculture, exploiting labor to maintain the food supply while reaping immense profits.</p><p>It’s a grim depiction of a future we must fight to prevent. A future where those imprisoned by the state are forced to toil in the fields to make up for the very labor shortages the state created. A future that reinforces systemic inequality and dehumanization.</p><h3>Don’t Let Them Go Hungry</h3><p>History teaches us that food insecurity is a precursor to revolution. When governments fail to feed their people, they eventually face the wrath of those left hungry. In mobilizing the machinery of the state to wage ideological battles, the Trump regime is ignoring the deeper threats to its own legitimacy.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40realjackq%2Fvideo%2F7464379490504887583&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@realjackq/video/7464379490504887583&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Trump has 72 hours.

While Biden banned asylum applications with a historic executive order in June 2024, Ukrainians benefited from an exception.  Johnson also pushed back by raising Indigenous peoples’ fight to reclaim their lands.&nbsp;The US was built following the displacement of Indigenous peoples. In 1887, four centuries after the Pan-European colonial project kicked off in the Americas, Indigenous tribes—whose population is estimated between 3.1 and 8.7 million—inhabited 138 million acres. Today, they control just 56 million acres. Parts of what are now western US states were under the control of Mexico before the Mexican-American War (1846-48), further seizing Indigenous peoples’ lands. With European imposition of colonial borders, Indigenous peoples could no longer freely trade, seek out food and travel. Similarly, what is now known as the US city of Chicago is land that numerous Indigenous tribes claim, including the Council of the Three Fires (representing three nations: Ojibwe, Odawa and Potawatomi), the Miami, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac, Fox, Kickapoo and Illinois Nations. Racist policies like the 1830 Indian Removal Act changed this, pushing out tens of thousands of Indigenous peoples. By 1910, the Indigenous population in Chicago dwindled to 188. The US government forced Indigenous peoples in Chicago west of the Mississippi River, where they live on ‘reservations’ that some have referred to as ‘concentration camps.’  #Chicago #Mayor #BrandonJohnson #DonaldTrump #MassDeportation #MississippiRiver #WeAreAllAfricanStream  Sources: https://iwgia.org/en/usa/5396-iw-2024-united-states.html https://www.ala.org/aboutala/offices/diversity/chicago-indigenous https://revenuedata.doi.gov/how-revenue-works/native-american-ownership-governance/ https://www.history.com/topics/19th-century/mexican-american-war https://www.salzburgglobal.org/news/topics/article/the-impact-of-colonial-borders-on-indigenous-communities  https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/mexican/becoming-part-of-the-united-states https://english.elpais.com/usa/2024-11-19/trump-deported-fewer-people-than-obama-clinton-or-bush-but-more-indiscriminately.html https://www.rescue.org/article/what-do-president-bidens-border-policies-mean-asylum-seekers https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2025/01/14/deportations-increased-ice-arrests-in-detroit-decreased-under-biden/77675042007&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/88-farm-labor-prison-labor-and-food-insecurity/d5a6e6ce-d68e-4078-b95e-992844a33065_1014x1473-d868a362.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Official Ahmed Kaballo&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40ahmedkaballo8%2Fvideo%2F7463697611011231009&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@ahmedkaballo8&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40ahmedkaballo8%2Fvideo%2F7463697611011231009&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40ahmedkaballo8%2Fvideo%2F7463697611011231009&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40ahmedkaballo8%2Fvideo%2F7463697611011231009&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ahmedkaballo8/video/7463697611011231009" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/88-farm-labor-prison-labor-and-food-insecurity/d5a6e6ce-d68e-4078-b95e-992844a33065_1014x1473-d868a362.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!X4Er!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd5a6e6ce-d68e-4078-b95e-992844a33065_1014x1473.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ahmedkaballo8" target="_blank">@ahmedkaballo8</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ahmedkaballo8/video/7463697611011231009" target="_blank">In this powerful clip, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson responded to the latest media flurry regarding US President Donald Trump’s plans for ‘mass deportation.’&nbsp; However, despite Trump’s rhetoric in his first term (2017-21), he deported 1.39 million migrants, fewer than his predecessors, Joe Biden (1.4 million deportations), Barack Obama (5 million deportations), George W Bush (more than 10 million deportations).&nbsp; Johnson pointed out that the US government allowed Ukrainians to seek asylum during the 2-1/2 years following the start of the war in Ukraine. While Biden banned asylum applications with a historic executive order in June 2024, Ukrainians benefited from an exception.  Johnson also pushed back by raising Indigenous peoples’ fight to reclaim their lands.&nbsp;The US was built following the displacement of Indigenous peoples. In 1887, four centuries after the Pan-European colonial project kicked off in the Americas, Indigenous tribes—whose population is estimated between 3.1 and 8.7 million—inhabited 138 million acres. Today, they control just 56 million acres. Parts of what are now western US states were under the control of Mexico before the Mexican-American War (1846-48), further seizing Indigenous peoples’ lands. With European imposition of colonial borders, Indigenous peoples could no longer freely trade, seek out food and travel. Similarly, what is now known as the US city of Chicago is land that numerous Indigenous tribes claim, including the Council of the Three Fires (representing three nations: Ojibwe, Odawa and Potawatomi), the Miami, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Sac, Fox, Kickapoo and Illinois Nations.
