In that moment I had a vision of driving in Eastern Ontario, encountering road blocks established by occupying forces, searching for dissidents and undocumented immigrants (which if you think about it, includes all of us).</p><p>Meanwhile I’ve got this Dylan song stuck in my head.</p><div class="pullquote"><p>You hand in your ticket and you go watch the geek<br>Who immediately walks up to you when he hears you speak<br>And says, "How does it feel to be such a freak?"<br>And you say, "Impossible!" as he hands you a bone<br>And something is happening here but you don't know what it is<br>Do you, Mr. Jones?</p></div><p>Canadians are grossly underestimating the existential threat we now face.</p><p>This isn't a distraction, nor a bluff.</p><p>It's not just tariffs, nor an economic war.</p><p>It is a complete redrawing of borders, inside of government and across the world.</p><p>A transformation and automation of the administrative state.</p><p>A rapid acceleration of politics as we know it.</p><p>At its core it is a media war, that shifts perception and attacks culture.</p><p>Canada is not only incredibly vulnerable, we can't even grasp what is happening, even though we all feel it in our hearts and soul.</p><p>Trying to buy Canadian when we shop at Walmart/Costco will not stop this.</p><p>Nothing is inevitable provided we are willing to pay attention, but something is happening, and you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones? 😎</p><div id="youtube2-63ucJmVonAc" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;63ucJmVonAc&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><div class="youtube-inner"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/63ucJmVonAc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div></div><p>In future issues we’ll elaborate on the characteristics, goals, and impact of this media war, but we’ve also been writing about this consistently as part of our focus on authority and its future.</p><p>The point however in drawing your attention to the media war is that it is not won or lost, or for that matter even fought in the way that people recognize. The content of a hockey game is less important than the message that is the media itself. Marshall McLuhan recognized the inclusive and immersive impact of media, and what we keep forgetting is that our media, and in particular our media narratives, are incredibly and infectiously American.</p><p>While we debate or even reject the idea of being the 51st state, it steadily and deeply creates an emotional home in our mind (living there rent free no doubt). This is how they roll, right over our conscious mind, engaging our collective mind, in a manner we might recognize but fail to stop.</p><p>Of course it can be stopped, but not by doing what we’re currently doing.
