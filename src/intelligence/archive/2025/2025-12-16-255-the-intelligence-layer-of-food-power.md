That understanding is what we mean by intelligence. And intelligence, in food systems, is never technical alone. It is cultural, social, and collective.</p><p>This is why our current food system is in crisis.</p><p>We neglect literacy. We extract data while excluding the public. We optimize production while hollowing out understanding. The result is a system that appears intelligent, yet fewer and fewer people understand it.</p><p>Food literacy is often treated as something that belongs to experts: agronomists, analysts, firms, platforms. Dashboards accumulate. Models proliferate. Yet the people whose bodies, health, and consent ultimately sustain the system remain largely illiterate about where food comes from and how it is produced.</p><p>Most eaters do not know how seasons shape availability, why certain crops dominate shelves, how labour conditions affect food quality, and what trade-offs exist between price, nutrition, and resilience.</p><p>This ignorance is a structural feature of a system that treats eaters as endpoints rather than participants.</p><p>Intelligence that cannot be understood cannot be employed. A public that does not grasp how food works cannot meaningfully support innovation, tolerate experimentation, or resist disinformation. In moments of stress: price spikes, climate shocks, and trade disruptions, illiteracy turns quickly into panic and backlash.</p><p>A system that seeks intelligence without investing in literacy concentrates authority and erodes legitimacy.</p><p>A resilient food system does not merely deliver food to people. It <strong>learns with them</strong>.</p><p>Every meal is feedback. Every preference reflects culture, health, memory, and possibility. When eaters are excluded from the learning process, intelligence narrows. When they are included, innovation expands.</p><p>Food literacy enables eaters to value nutrition and flavour over uniformity, understand seasonal variation rather than reject it, support experimentation rather than punish deviation, and distinguish quality from marketing.</p><p>This transforms consumption into participation. The food system becomes a dialogue rather than a pipeline. Innovation accelerates not because people eat more, but because they <strong>know enough to ask better questions</strong>.</p><h2>Domestic Food Systems as Learning Cultures</h2><p>Universal domestic food provisioning does more than guarantee access. It creates the conditions for sustained learning.</p><p>When survival is not constantly at stake, producers can experiment. Crops can be diversified without market punishment. Breeds can be selected for flavour and nutrition rather than transport durability. Processing methods, especially fermentation and preservation, can be explored over time, not rushed to fit quarterly margins.</p><p>Domestic food systems, when designed as infrastructure, become <strong>learning cultures</strong> where regions develop distinctive food identities, producers and eaters co-evolve taste, and feedback loops become continuous rather than episodic.</p><p>Export systems chase trends. Domestic systems create them.</p><p>This is where intelligence accumulates, not as data points, but as shared understanding embedded in practice.</p><p>Food literacy is often framed as education. In reality, it is <strong>strategic infrastructure</strong>.</p><p>A literate public reduces susceptibility to food misinformation, stabilizes political support for long-term policy, tolerates necessary trade-offs during transition, and defends the system when it is attacked.</p><p>This literacy can be cultivated through school food programs tied to production and ecology, transparent domestic food systems people can see and understand, public-facing data and storytelling that invite interpretation, and cultural legitimacy for farming and food work.</p><p>Data definitely plays a role, but only when it serves learning rather than extraction.</p><p>Today, agricultural data is increasingly captured by private platforms that enclose insight while externalizing risk. Farmers generate information they do not control. Public investment underwrites private advantage. Intelligence accumulates upward, while understanding thins out below.</p><p>True food intelligence works differently.</p><p>It circulates. It is interpretable. It strengthens relationships rather than replacing them. Treated as public infrastructure, agricultural data lowers barriers to entry, reduces systemic risk, and enables faster, distributed innovation.</p><p>This is where the global advantage emerges: not through volume, but through <strong>products with no peers</strong>.</p><p>A food system that learns with its public can produce vegetables with superior nutrient density and flavour, meat that reflects feed, care, and long-term knowledge rather than speed, fermented products with complex, place-specific taste profiles, and foods whose quality cannot be replicated without replicating the learning culture itself.</p><p>These products cannot be reverse-engineered easily. They require years of shared intelligence, experimentation, and feedback. They are not commodities. They are expressions of collective capacity.</p><p>This is where export power becomes durable. Not because others are excluded from knowledge, but because they cannot shortcut culture.</p><h2>Why Industry Benefits From Literacy</h2><p>Industry often treats public literacy as a risk: something that invites scrutiny or slows adoption. In reality, the opposite is true.</p><p>A literate public supports premium pricing grounded in real quality, accelerates adoption of meaningful innovation, reduces reputational and regulatory volatility, and trains producers for the most demanding global markets.</p><p>The most valuable export markets are educated markets. A literate domestic public becomes a proving ground for excellence. Entrepreneurs do not lose advantage when intelligence circulates. They gain context, credibility, and time.</p><p>Yet there are dangers and risks to guard against.</p><p>Food intelligence must not become surveillance. Literacy must not be reduced to marketing. Transparency must not substitute for participation. Metrics must not replace judgment.</p><p>Intelligence should empower people to act, not discipline them into compliance.</p><p>Once food systems generate intelligence <em>and</em> literacy at scale, the final questions are no longer technical.</p><p>They are political.</p><p>Who governs shared intelligence? How are trade and diplomacy reshaped by food power? What institutions must change—and which can be repurposed? What can be implemented now, rather than imagined later?</p><p>Part IV will address these questions directly. It will move from vision to execution, from authority to action.</p><p>Because power follows intelligence. But authority follows literacy and what we do with it.</p><div class="digest-post-embed" data-attrs="{&quot;nodeId&quot;:&quot;da701509-e817-448c-8e44-959045e5883d&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;Free Food, Real Profits&quot;,&quot;cta&quot;:&quot;Read full story&quot;,&quot;showBylines&quot;:true,&quot;size&quot;:&quot;sm&quot;,&quot;isEditorNode&quot;:true,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;256: How Food Power Gets Built&quot;,&quot;publishedBylines&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:3820200,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jesse Hirsh&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Futurist, farmer, researcher, public speaker, and punk.&quot;,&quot;photo_url&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ab2544a0-6a4a-478b-8868-ba08e1bf7454_512x512.jpeg&quot;,&quot;is_guest&quot;:false,&quot;bestseller_tier&quot;:null}],&quot;post_date&quot;:&quot;2025-12-17T11:55:10.853Z&quot;,&quot;cover_image&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!AMZi!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb790e3f0-12ea-481e-9745-59d89f65fbb8_960x1417.jpeg&quot;,&quot;cover_image_alt&quot;:null,&quot;canonical_url&quot;:&quot;https://metaviews.substack.com/p/256-how-food-power-gets-built&quot;,&quot;section_name&quot;:null,&quot;video_upload_id&quot;:null,&quot;id&quot;:181880067,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;newsletter&quot;,&quot;reaction_count&quot;:0,&quot;comment_count&quot;:0,&quot;publication_id&quot;:2229058,&quot;publication_name&quot;:&quot;Metaviews: Future of Authority &quot;,&quot;publication_logo_url&quot;:&quot;https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!0EgC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3cc7f0e9-b25c-4123-bc10-9bba4e827c9f_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;youtube_url&quot;:null,&quot;show_links&quot;:null,&quot;feed_url&quot;:null}"></div><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40josephabrassey%2Fvideo%2F7583017023471504670&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@josephabrassey/video/7583017023471504670&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Washington state owes a debt of gratitude to its indigenous population right now. #pacificnorthwest #atmosphericriver #waflood #indiginous #politics &quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/255-the-intelligence-layer-of-food-power/74746d75-fbdd-4c4a-a69f-ec3d9000e43c_1080x1920-74bd2055.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Joseph Brassey&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40josephabrassey%2Fvideo%2F7583017023471504670&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@josephabrassey&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40josephabrassey%2Fvideo%2F7583017023471504670&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40josephabrassey%2Fvideo%2F7583017023471504670&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay;
