But because of a sustained campaign of self-sabotage, detachment, and political cowardice. A once-vital voice for the working class and social justice has withered into a husk—out of touch, out of time, and out of relevance.</p><p>It didn’t have to be this way.</p><p>But the party failed to adapt to a rapidly changing political terrain. Rather than renew its ties with the social movements that birthed it—labour, peace, feminism, anti-racism—it opted to chase legitimacy in the very institutions that neutered it. Instead of building power on the streets, it begged for approval in the halls of Parliament.</p><p>The contemporary labour movement is no longer the reliable ally the NDP once assumed it to be. Many unions have shifted to the political centre—or even the right—embracing pragmatism, nationalism, and corporate compromise over radical solidarity.</p><p>Meanwhile, movements for climate justice, Indigenous sovereignty, migrant rights, trans liberation, and Palestinian freedom have surged. And while the NDP tried to keep up, they did so without conviction or coherence.</p><h2>The Case Against Zionism</h2><p>In particular the issue wasn’t silence on Palestine. The NDP did speak—vaguely, cautiously, and only when pressed. But they never made the argument.</p><p>They failed to lead a principled, public case <em>against Zionism</em>—to distinguish it from Judaism, to oppose it as a settler-colonial ideology, and to frame that opposition in terms Canadians could understand and embrace. In a country built on colonization, where the struggle for Indigenous sovereignty is both real and resonant, the opportunity to connect Palestine to Canada’s own history of land theft and cultural genocide was not just strategic—it was <em>obvious</em>.</p><p>Yet the NDP flinched. They feared backlash. They opted for platitudes instead of courage. And so the Liberals got away with performative empathy while backing Israeli war crimes, and the Conservatives embraced the full MAGA-Zionist alliance, cheering genocide under the guise of anti-terrorism.</p><p>A real left party would have built a mainstream popular anti-Zionist position rooted in solidarity, decolonization, and Jewish voices of conscience. The NDP, trapped in triangulation, let that window close.</p><p>In a bid for mainstream credibility, the NDP softened every edge. They blurred the lines between themselves and the Liberals, offering modest reforms instead of bold vision. And when push came to shove—on climate, pharmacare, and foreign policy—they blinked.</p><p>Voters noticed. Movements noticed. And the 2025 election delivered the final blow: only seven seats, not enough for official party status. Leaderless, rudderless, irrelevant.</p><h2>Roleplay: The PMO’s Grand Strategy</h2><p>Let’s shift perspective for a moment. Imagine you're in the Prime Minister's Office. You’re Mark Carney. You’ve just won 168 seats—four short of a majority. Trump is threatening the border. The Conservative Party is MAGA in all but name. You need a wartime Cabinet. A coalition of the sane.</p><p>Here’s the plan.</p><h3>Operation: Absorb the NDP</h3><p>The seven NDP MPs offer an opportunity. They are experienced, principled, and ideologically closer to the Liberals than they admit. Here's what you offer:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Heather McPherson</strong> becomes Minister for International Development, reorienting Canada's role abroad as a human rights bulwark against Trumpism.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don Davies</strong> finally gets to implement national pharmacare as Minister of Health.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jenny Kwan</strong> is empowered to tackle housing and immigration as Minister for Urban Affairs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gord Johns</strong> gets Fisheries and Oceans, with a mandate for climate resilience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lori Idlout</strong> leads Crown-Indigenous Relations, reshaping Arctic sovereignty policy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leah Gazan</strong> is appointed Special Envoy on Truth and Reconciliation, backed by a new federal fund for Indigenous-led development.</p></li><li><p><strong>Alexandre Boulerice</strong> is offered Official Languages and Labour, shaping a pro-worker, pro-francophone national strategy.</p></li></ul><p>The pitch? This isn’t about betrayal. It’s about building a government that can withstand Trump, MAGA, and the far right—at home and abroad.</p><p>And of course, you only need four of them.</p><h2>Zombie Party, Undead Politics</h2><p>What’s left of the NDP is a zombie: stumbling, half-conscious, no longer animated by purpose. It shuffles along, chasing relevance, refusing to accept that it has already died.</p><p>And that's dangerous. Because it gets in the way.</p><p>Movements need a real political vehicle. Not a half-hearted echo of Liberalism. Not a faded memory of past glory. If a new left is to rise, it needs clarity, courage, and a willingness to fight—not just for seats, but for a future.</p><p>Let the NDP rest. Or better yet, let it be buried.</p><p>In its place, we must build something new. Let the Liberals take on Trump while a new political movement, whether party, or network, can emerge to deal with what comes next.</p><p>Liberalism is what killed the NDP. And liberalism will also be the downfall of the Liberal party. Time to focus our efforts on the future of authority so that authoritarianism can be defeated before it defeats us.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40channel5tiktok%2Fvideo%2F7490723941741268254&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@channel5tiktok/video/7490723941741268254&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Breaking news- our new weekly show 5cast, has launched, and is available now #channel5 #5cast #andrewcallaghan&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/169-the-death-of-the-ndp/e503c072-1753-4d30-9182-13841ba3a49d_1200x1719-8dc88171.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Channel 5 News&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40channel5tiktok%2Fvideo%2F7490723941741268254&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@channel5tiktok&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40channel5tiktok%2Fvideo%2F7490723941741268254&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40channel5tiktok%2Fvideo%2F7490723941741268254&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40channel5tiktok%2Fvideo%2F7490723941741268254&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@channel5tiktok/video/7490723941741268254" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/169-the-death-of-the-ndp/e503c072-1753-4d30-9182-13841ba3a49d_1200x1719-8dc88171.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!EaLP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe503c072-1753-4d30-9182-13841ba3a49d_1200x1719.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@channel5tiktok" target="_blank">@channel5tiktok</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@channel5tiktok/video/7490723941741268254" target="_blank">Breaking news- our new weekly show 5cast, has launched, and is available now #channel5 #5cast #andrewcallaghan</a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40channel5tiktok%2Fvideo%2F7490723941741268254&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/169-the-death-of-the-ndp/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
