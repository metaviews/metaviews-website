Authority Is.</h1><p><em>A dispatch from the year 2050.</em></p><p>Greetings from the other side of the paradox.</p><p>It’s strange now to recall that, for centuries, we believed in money. We measured everything by it: our time, our worth, our survival. We called it "the economy," as if it were something separate from nature, from people, from reality itself.</p><p>Of course, none of it was real.<br>Money was a story.<br>Authority was the author.</p><p>The collapse of that story — and the liberation that followed — was not inevitable. It came at great cost. But it came.</p><p>The final crisis arrived faster than anyone expected.</p><p>In the late 2020s, after Trump’s return to power, the fusion of state corruption and financial fantasy accelerated. The farce reached its climax with the full-scale institutional embrace of cryptocurrency.</p><p>Markets ballooned beyond all connection to material production. Entire national budgets were collateralized by decentralized ledgers nobody controlled, but everyone gamed.</p><p>Then came the crash.</p><p>What we now call <strong>The Great Trump Depression</strong> began with the collapse of crypto-finance. Banks failed. States defaulted. Supply chains froze. Billions lost access to credit, to wages, to the fictions that had governed daily life.</p><p>But unlike earlier panics, something remarkable happened.</p><p>People finally asked:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What exactly did we lose?</strong></p></blockquote><p>With money discredited, the political horizon widened overnight.</p><p>For generations, we had been told we could not afford:</p><ul><li><p>Universal healthcare.</p></li><li><p>Guaranteed food security.</p></li><li><p>Decarbonization.</p></li><li><p>Restorative land stewardship.</p></li><li><p>Global poverty eradication.</p></li></ul><p>We believed these were problems of scarcity.<br>In truth, they were problems of imagination.</p><p>The financial system had functioned as a bottleneck, not a resource allocator. A game designed to protect existing authority, not distribute abundance. A medium that transformed collective capacities into artificial shortages.</p><blockquote><p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5,000_Years">David Graeber</a> once wrote:<br><em>“There’s no better way to justify inequality than to pretend it’s the inevitable consequence of impersonal market forces.”</em></p></blockquote><p>When the markets dissolved, so too did their authority.</p><p>At first, barter re-emerged.<br>Then coordinated resource networks.</p><p>Trust remained.<br>Obligation remained.<br>Gift economies, mutual aid, and localized planning flourished.</p><p>The paradox was revealed:<br>We had never needed money to coordinate labor or distribute goods — we only needed systems of trust, accountability, and shared purpose.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FATQ0Yf0Fhc">Stephanie Kelton</a>’s argument was vindicated retroactively:<br>Governments had never been financially constrained — they were politically constrained by adherence to a false narrative about money's scarcity.</p><p>Once freed from that narrative, planning replaced pricing.<br>Cooperation replaced competition.<br>Resource abundance replaced manufactured scarcity.</p><h2>Money as Dead Media</h2><p>Today, in 2050, we study money the way historians once studied obsolete communication tools.</p><ul><li><p>Shells.</p></li><li><p>Coins.</p></li><li><p>Credit Cards.</p></li><li><p>Digital tokens.</p></li></ul><p>Each iteration had less to do with value than with authority.<br>Each collapse brought us closer to the realization that money was never real — only the relations it mediated were.</p><p>Marshall McLuhan, who few took seriously in his time, was precisely correct:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Money is a medium. Its content was always trust. Its effect was always control.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Money was the most persuasive — and ultimately most fragile — medium of authority.</p><p>Once authority was reclaimed, the medium was discarded.</p><p>The climate crisis forced our hand.</p><p>We could not afford to keep pretending that the planet would wait for prices to signal action.</p><p>In rejecting money as the arbiter of possibility, we returned to older truths:</p><ul><li><p>The Earth is finite.</p></li><li><p>Human creativity is infinite.</p></li><li><p>What we produce is bounded by material limits, not by accounting entries.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>We are no longer ruled by the lie of money.<br>We are governed by the reality of responsibility.</p></blockquote><p>That is the true gift economy:<br>Not barter, not charity — but the collective stewardship of life itself.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40www.indi.ca%2Fvideo%2F7512695668301974789&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@www.indi.ca/video/7512695668301974789&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;America can't attack China without China's help #China #USA #War #Military&quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/195-the-great-trump-depression-and-the-end-of-money/acf4e8e6-1693-4ab5-9474-20ddefe18935_1080x1920-107fbd72.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;www.indi.ca&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40www.indi.ca%2Fvideo%2F7512695668301974789&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@www.indi.ca&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40www.indi.ca%2Fvideo%2F7512695668301974789&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40www.indi.ca%2Fvideo%2F7512695668301974789&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40www.indi.ca%2Fvideo%2F7512695668301974789&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@www.indi.ca/video/7512695668301974789" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/195-the-great-trump-depression-and-the-end-of-money/acf4e8e6-1693-4ab5-9474-20ddefe18935_1080x1920-107fbd72.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MgxN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Facf4e8e6-1693-4ab5-9474-20ddefe18935_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@www.indi.ca" target="_blank">@www.indi.ca</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@www.indi.ca/video/7512695668301974789" target="_blank">America can't attack China without China's help #China #USA #War #Military</a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40www.indi.ca%2Fvideo%2F7512695668301974789&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/195-the-great-trump-depression-and-the-end-of-money/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div>
