A kind of virus that spreads all across the globe, connecting as many people as possible to the network of networks.</p><p name="6f51" id="6f51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Never satisfied, the Internet is now moving beyond people to connect all the objects in our world, creating something called the Internet of Things (IoT).</p><p name="40a2" id="40a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The rise of the Internet of Things is happening faster than anyone has anticipated. Home appliances, cars, factories, office spaces, event spaces, all the areas and objects that people use are starting to go online.</p><p name="47ba" id="47ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the reasons people are embracing this Internet of Things is that it genuinely helps us make better use of those “things”, providing data about their state, their relationship with us, and their greater potential with regard to uses we may not have previously anticipated.</p><figure name="ea8e" id="ea8e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*jviETSTk6ACXZwrA6w6nTw.jpeg" data-width="6940" data-height="2933" src="/assets/medium/2016-11-16-the-internet-of-hackable-things/1-jviETSTk6ACXZwrA6w6nTw-f415f750.jpeg"></figure><p name="392f" id="392f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">For example, imagine an event using IoT technology to better understand where people are spending their time, which exhibits or spaces are more popular, and how people are reacting to programming and activities. The appeal of the Internet of Things is real, and the applications are growing rapidly.</p><p name="af2e" id="af2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unfortunately this speed of adoption is out pacing our ability to properly secure and contemplate the impact these devices will have.</p><p name="ed17" id="ed17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the great vulnerabilities of our era arises from the difference in speed between humans and software. Our velocity is significantly slower than that of machines. There’s only so much we can do in the course of a day. Software on the other hand never gets tired, and can operate at the speed of light.</p><p name="1ad4" id="1ad4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We tend not to think of this speed difference when we buy a baby monitor that uses wifi so we can monitor our kids while they sleep, while we sit in another room. We don’t take the time to learn how to properly secure said baby monitor, let alone the new fridge that has Internet access, or the digital video recorder (DVR) that is always left on.</p><figure name="755d" id="755d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*0tkNoiVNIAagEj6Yw1ppRg.jpeg" data-width="1600" data-height="1032" src="/assets/medium/2016-11-16-the-internet-of-hackable-things/1-0tkNoiVNIAagEj6Yw1ppRg-25b83285.jpeg"></figure><p name="0ae1" id="0ae1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Software on the other hand can rapidly crawl across the Internet of Things, probing for back doors, checking for default passwords that have never been changed.</p><p name="2c4d" id="2c4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Recently a piece of open source software called Mirai was published on the Internet. It is a kind of malicious software, or malware, that can crawl across the Internet of Things finding devices to hack, uniting them into a larger army of zombie computers ready and willing to follow the commands of the person running the software, or anyone who pays them for the privilege to do so.</p><p name="2d4a" id="2d4a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This came to the public’s attention when someone used thousands of hacked baby monitors, discovered via the use of Mirai, to disable a significant part of the US east coast Internet. All of a sudden people started to realize just how insecure the Internet of Things may be. Our rush to connect the things in our world and collect as much data as possible has left us vulnerable to a new era of insecurity.</p><p name="9113" id="9113" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, many insurance companies are embracing IoT technology to help them monitor the habits of drivers, or monitors the state of your home. They offer potentially lower rates as they can better profile and understand their customer. However what happens if and when those tracking devices are hacked. Who is responsible in such a situation? The customer in possession of the device or the company that encouraged them to adopt it?</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="7587" id="7587" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*GrkiDV0BVVwj53vzee-EcA.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="630" src="/assets/medium/2016-11-16-the-internet-of-hackable-things/1-GrkiDV0BVVwj53vzee-EcA-88befc68.jpeg"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="5fe1" id="5fe1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We need to be careful about the devices we use, how they are connected, what data they collect, and most importantly how they are secured and maintained. Technology is dynamic, and security is ongoing. If we want to use these new (and exciting) tools, then we need to take responsibility for them as well. Tragically most users of technology have not been willing to take responsibility for their tools, and this may get a whole lot worse as we become surrounded by more objects that track our activities and habits.</p><p name="bda3" id="bda3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The world of open source provides us with a powerful framework by which to approach the Internet of Things.</p><p name="6f79" id="6f79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Part of the reason Mirai was so successful in attacking the Internet of Things was because it was open source, and different attackers were able to share and learn from the lessons that it offered.</p><p name="1d79" id="1d79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the ways to make it easier for users of IoT to take responsibility for their technology is if it too is also open source. Open source makes security easier as patches can be shared, solutions can be applied across the system, and many hands can make for a lighter load.</p><p name="2f42" id="2f42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Similarly there needs to be transparency when it comes to how our data is used, so that when we enter environments where IoT technology is tracking, and profiling us, we can respond accordingly.</p><p name="cea0" id="cea0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally open source allows the IoT to continue to spread as rapidly as possible, while making it easier for anyone to understand and leverage the technology for themselves.</p><figure name="163f" id="163f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*wUkYCrGqwiBQHO_uR8GOsg.jpeg" data-width="3200" data-height="2120" src="/assets/medium/2016-11-16-the-internet-of-hackable-things/1-wUkYCrGqwiBQHO_uR8GOsg-835a3ffb.jpeg"></figure><p name="d26e" id="d26e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Of course, a large part of the Internet of Things is already open source, driven by technology like the Raspberry Pi and commitments from many companies to share the software they use to enable it.</p><p name="41d4" id="41d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However consumers themselves also need to add the logic of open source to their purchasing positions. Are the connected devices that you’re buying open source? Are you able to verify and maintain their security with ease and convenience?</p><p name="4311" id="4311" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">These are questions you need to ask yourself before wading further into the Internet of Things.</p></div></div></section><section name="a760" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure name="6ff9" id="6ff9" class="graf graf--figure graf--leading"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*BCPHt6CI9Umt51xZvOO-wA.jpeg" data-width="600" data-height="400" src="/assets/medium/2016-11-16-the-internet-of-hackable-things/1-BCPHt6CI9Umt51xZvOO-wA-3d900b3f.jpeg"></figure><p name="0dd5" id="0dd5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><a href="https://www.nsb.com/speakers/jesse-hirsh/" data-href="https://www.nsb.com/speakers/jesse-hirsh/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jesse Hirsh</a> is an artist, futurist, researcher and internet strategist.
