> Trust is the chicken soup of social life.</p><p>It brings us all sorts of good things—from a willingness to get involved in our communities to higher rates of economic growth ( …), to making daily life more pleasant.</p><p>Yet, like chicken soup, it appears to work somewhat mysteriously. (Uslaner)I asked Sherida Ryan to host a discussion at the Academy of the Impossible about trust in the age of transparency.</p><p>Here’s the description and video:> Normally, we are unaware of the trust process.</p><p>We often take trust for granted and treat it like the air we breathe, noticing it “only when it becomes scarce or polluted” (Baier).</p><p>Trust requires two conditions: risk and dependence.</p><p>Risk occurs when a person encounters a situation where perfect information is not available, where the future is unpredictable, and where there is a possibility of loss or harm.</p><p>Risk creates the opportunity for trust development.</p><p>Dependence is the second feature.</p><p>Trust grows out of the interdependent nature of tasks, where one party relies on another, or perhaps many others, to achieve some desired result.> > Research about trust has increased over the past 20 years, some say because of the advent of computer-mediated environment.</p><p>The affordances of computer-mediated interaction can pose a challenge for the development of trust.</p><p>Trust comes into question as situations become complex and uncertain.</p><p>How can you trust people you have never met, whose identity is difficult to verify, in an environment where there are few mechanisms to control or sanction anti-social behaviour?> > Similar to discussions of trust in face-to-face environments, the issue of trust in computer-mediated contexts has been approached from several perspectives.</p><p>The most popular being what is known as trust through security.</p><p>According to this perspective, online trust is best established through the development of strong security mechanisms (for example, access control and surveillance).</p><p>This argument is predicated on the perspective that a perfectly secure system will ensure trustworthy online behavior.> > However equating trust with security indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of trust.</p><p>Eliminating risk reduces opportunities for trust formation, removing situations where a successful experience in negotiating dependence and vulnerability facilitates the development of trust.</p><p>Paradoxically, attempts to assure trust through ever-increasing levels of security or surveillance lead to a climate of mistrust.</p><p>An emphasis on security issues constrain the scope and quality of peoples’ lives, resulting in gated communities, characterized by suspicion and hording of public goods.> > So what becomes of trust in an age of transparency.(Source: <https://www.youtube.com/>)
