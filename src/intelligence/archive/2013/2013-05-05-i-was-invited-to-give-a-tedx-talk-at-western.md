https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFRRIuW0giMI was invited to give a [TEDx talk at Western University](http://www.uwo.ca/tedx/) and I decided to present some of the knowledge that has emerged via the Hacking Reality program at the Academy of the Impossible. Explicitly I focused on how the internet impacts our relationship with authority, and as a result our relationship with reality. The opportunity therefore is to hack reality, and demand the impossible.If you find it entertaining please share widely.(Source: <https://www.youtube.com/>)
