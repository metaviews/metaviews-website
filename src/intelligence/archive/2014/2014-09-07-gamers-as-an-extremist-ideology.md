[Gamers as an extremist ideology](http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/columnists/technology/2014/09/01/gamers/)I play video games, but I would never identify myself as a gamer.</p><p>Even worse, I argue that enough of those who do are turning the identity and adjacent ideology into a dangerous kind of extremism.</p><p>I spoke with Matt Galloway, host of CBC’s Metro Morning about the subject.
