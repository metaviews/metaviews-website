It transforms into a flashpoint that reveals deeper tensions within society. Luigi Mangione's arraignment on charges of murder and terrorism, following the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has ignited protests, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/luigi-mangione-conspiracy-theories-eyebrows-286-monopoly/">inspired conspiracy theories</a>, and become a lightning rod for conversations about authority, justice, and power.</p><p>But why this case? Why now?</p><p>Since Mangione's arrest, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/memes/luigi-mangione-apple-dance/">supporters have rallied outside courthouses</a>, and online campaigns have raised thousands for his legal defense. Protesters, many wearing “Luigi” hats, have positioned him as a folk hero, reflecting deep-seated frustration with the healthcare system. Signs like “Deny, Delay, Depose” mirror widespread resentment toward the insurance industry's perceived prioritization of profit over human life.</p><p>Yet, this isn’t just about healthcare. The case has tapped into broader anxieties about corporate power and economic inequity. In a nation where nearly 100 million people face medical debt, Mangione’s story resonates as both a tragedy and a parable. His supporters argue that his actions, however extreme, are emblematic of a larger moral outrage: the systemic dehumanization of patients by an industry designed to heal.</p><h3>The State's Response: Murder and Terrorism Charges</h3><p>The state’s decision to charge Mangione with terrorism, in addition to murder, is telling. It suggests an acute awareness of the symbolic power of his alleged act. By labeling him a terrorist, the state aims to delegitimize the grassroots support he’s garnered and to frame his actions as a threat not just to one individual but to the stability of the system itself.</p><p>The terrorism charge also creates a chilling effect. It signals to others that any act of violence against powerful institutions will be met with the full force of the state. This isn’t just about punishing Mangione—it’s about deterring the kind of collective unrest his story could inspire.</p><h3>The Haircut Heard Around the World</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!q2D9!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe5df5787-6986-4ebc-ba31-a227244b5fb3_1284x1428.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" sizes="100vw"><img src="/assets/substack/58-luigi-gets-a-haircut/e5df5787-6986-4ebc-ba31-a227244b5fb3_1284x1428-c615575c.jpeg" width="342" height="380.3551401869159" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/58-luigi-gets-a-haircut/e5df5787-6986-4ebc-ba31-a227244b5fb3_1284x1428-c615575c.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1428,&quot;width&quot;:1284,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:342,&quot;bytes&quot;:133775,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></a></figure></div><p>Even Mangione’s personal appearance has become a source of scrutiny. His fade haircut, common in prison culture, has been interpreted as a signal of protection within the system. To some, it represents his ability to navigate prison hierarchies; to others, it’s a carefully calculated image meant to convey discipline and control.</p><p>This focus on his grooming—alongside speculation about his eyebrow modification—speaks to our cultural obsession with symbols and the way they shape narratives. In an era of information abundance, even the smallest details become fodder for speculation, fueling conspiracy theories and public fascination.</p><div id="tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40kissing_whiskey%2Fvideo%2F7450562225598680363&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-wrap outer" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@kissing_whiskey/video/7450562225598680363&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;That man is taken CARE OF #yap #fyp #haircut &quot;,&quot;thumbnail_url&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/58-luigi-gets-a-haircut/5d993e3d-cb9d-4435-a9b5-60a179066a40_1080x1920-f3c8cb0e.jpeg&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;KissingWhiskeyVintage&quot;,&quot;embed_url&quot;:&quot;https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40kissing_whiskey%2Fvideo%2F7450562225598680363&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd&quot;,&quot;author_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@kissing_whiskey&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="TikTokCreateTikTokEmbed"><iframe id="iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40kissing_whiskey%2Fvideo%2F7450562225598680363&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="tiktok-iframe" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40kissing_whiskey%2Fvideo%2F7450562225598680363&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe><iframe src="https://team-hosted-public.s3.amazonaws.com/set-then-check-cookie.html" id="third-party-iframe-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40kissing_whiskey%2Fvideo%2F7450562225598680363&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd" class="third-party-cookie-check-iframe" style="display: none;" loading="lazy"></iframe><div class="tiktok-wrap static" data-component-name="TikTokCreateStaticTikTokEmbed"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kissing_whiskey/video/7450562225598680363" target="_blank"><img class="tiktok thumbnail" src="/assets/substack/58-luigi-gets-a-haircut/5d993e3d-cb9d-4435-a9b5-60a179066a40_1080x1920-f3c8cb0e.jpeg" style="background-image: url(https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ej44!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d993e3d-cb9d-4435-a9b5-60a179066a40_1080x1920.jpeg);" loading="lazy"></a><div class="content"><a class="author" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kissing_whiskey" target="_blank">@kissing_whiskey</a><a class="title" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kissing_whiskey/video/7450562225598680363" target="_blank">That man is taken CARE OF #yap #fyp #haircut </a></div></div><div class="fallback-failure" id="fallback-failure-tiktok-iframe?media=1&amp;app=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40kissing_whiskey%2Fvideo%2F7450562225598680363&amp;key=e27c740634285c9ddc20db64f73358dd"><div class="error-content"><img class="error-icon" src="/assets/substack/58-luigi-gets-a-haircut/alert-circle-6641db5d.svg" loading="lazy">Tiktok failed to load.<br><br>Enable 3rd party cookies or use another browser</div></div></div><h3>A Parallel: Briana Boston and the Fear of Contagion</h3><p>The case of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czenlg5d5rjo">Briana Boston</a> offers a striking parallel. Boston, who was charged with threatening an act of terrorism after saying “Delay, deny, depose, you people are next” while on the line with an insurance rep. The state’s response—severe charges and a high bail—was similarly designed to dissuade others from following her lead.</p><p>Like Mangione, Boston’s case highlighted a growing divide between the public and institutions of authority. In both instances, the charges went beyond the immediate acts, targeting the broader symbolic implications of their actions. The state isn’t just prosecuting individuals—it’s attempting to control the narrative.</p><p>The Luigi Mangione moment is about more than one man. It’s a reflection of the state’s precarious position in an age of growing discontent. When traditional sources of authority—corporations, governments, even the courts—are viewed with skepticism, individuals like Mangione and Boston become avatars for broader societal frustrations.</p><p>By framing Mangione as both a murderer and a terrorist, the state seeks to reassert control, to remind the public that challenges to authority will not be tolerated. But in doing so, it risks amplifying his message and fueling the very unrest it seeks to quell.</p><p>The question is: Who holds the ultimate authority in shaping these narratives? The state, the media, or the people?</p><p>The protests, the conspiracies, even the focus on Mangione’s haircut—these are all indicators of a society grappling with what authority means in a time of crisis.</p><p>The larger variable in all of this is TikTok, and whether the platform will be banned in early January 2025. Stay tuned…</p>
