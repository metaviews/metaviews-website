It’s a simple, seductive idea: work hard, show initiative, and success will follow. But the reality? Conformity, competition, and compliance are valued over compassion, cooperation, and creativity. Buzzwords like “inclusion” and “diversity” are the latest distractions in a system that fundamentally rewards obedience over genuine innovation or equity.</p><p>At the heart of this lie is the HR department—a tool not for empowering employees but for protecting the company’s interests. To break free from this corporate myth, we must reimagine how work is structured and how contributions are measured.</p><h3>The Human Repression Department</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2foD!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1ad6692e-53d0-4132-8f81-c63069f6abe4_2048x2048.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" sizes="100vw"><img src="/assets/substack/the-myth-of-corporate-meritocracy/1ad6692e-53d0-4132-8f81-c63069f6abe4_2048x2048-63333569.png" width="1456" height="1456" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;/assets/substack/the-myth-of-corporate-meritocracy/1ad6692e-53d0-4132-8f81-c63069f6abe4_2048x2048-63333569.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1456,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4307057,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" sizes="100vw"></picture></a></figure></div><p>Human Resources is a misnomer. Despite its name, HR is not about advocating for workers. It exists to serve the company’s bottom line. From enforcing rigid hierarchies to suppressing dissent, HR departments act as the gatekeepers of corporate control. They’re there to ensure the company’s legal protection and manage public relations, not to promote fairness or address systemic inequalities within the workplace.</p><p>Take performance reviews, for instance. Ostensibly designed to reward individual effort, they often become exercises in subjective judgment and political maneuvering. Workers are pitted against one another in a zero-sum game where promotions and raises are scarce. This dynamic stifles collaboration and breeds a culture of fear and compliance.</p><p>Moreover, initiatives around “diversity” and “inclusion” often amount to little more than PR strategies. Companies trot out statistics and corporate statements while maintaining structures that perpetuate inequality. True equity and empowerment are sidelined in favor of superficial tokenism.</p><h3>A New Model: Leveling the Playing Field</h3><p>What if corporations adopted a model akin to that of a video game or MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game)? In these environments, everyone starts at the same level, with equal opportunities to gain experience, develop skills, and rise through the ranks.</p><p>Here’s how such a system could work:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Transparent Progression</strong>: Everyone begins with equal standing, and career advancement is based on clear, quantifiable metrics. Contributions are tracked and rewarded, whether they come from problem-solving, teamwork, or creative innovation.</p></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Recognizing All Contributions</strong>: In many companies, only a narrow range of achievements—often tied to sales or management—are rewarded. But in a game-like system, roles such as mentorship, community building, and technical expertise would have measurable value. Workers could "level up" in various ways, reflecting the multifaceted nature of contribution.</p></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>Encouraging Collaboration</strong>: MMORPGs thrive on teamwork. Players often form guilds or alliances, pooling their skills to tackle complex challenges. A corporate equivalent could foster a culture where collaboration is incentivized and rewarded, rather than penalized through competition.</p></li></ol><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>Skill Trees and Specialization</strong>: In games, players choose paths that reflect their strengths and interests. Similarly, employees could chart personalized career paths, developing specialized skills that are acknowledged and rewarded by the organization.</p></li></ol><ol start="5"><li><p><strong>Real Loyalty Programs</strong>: Today’s corporations expect loyalty without offering it in return. A game-based model could reward loyalty in tangible ways, providing long-term incentives for staying with the company, such as profit-sharing or increased autonomy in decision-making.</p></li></ol><h3>Why This Matters</h3><p>This model isn’t just about fairness; it’s about unlocking the full potential of the workforce. When people feel that their contributions are genuinely valued, they are more engaged, innovative, and loyal. By contrast, the current system of arbitrary advancement and token recognition demoralizes workers and stifles organizational growth.</p><p>Moreover, this approach aligns with the evolving expectations of younger generations entering the workforce. Millennials and Gen Z are less inclined to buy into the traditional corporate ladder and are demanding more transparency, equity, and meaning in their work.</p><h3>Current Reality vs. Future Potential</h3><p>The myth of the corporate meritocracy persists because it serves those at the top. It justifies inequality and masks systemic barriers under the guise of “fairness.” But the cracks in this narrative are becoming harder to ignore.</p><p>Organizations that fail to evolve will continue to lose talent to more innovative, equitable models. Meanwhile, those willing to rethink how they value and reward contributions could lead a revolution in how work is structured—one where meritocracy is not just a buzzword, but a lived reality.</p><h3>Further Reading</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Harvard Business Review on the Myth of Meritocracy:</strong> <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/07/the-myth-of-the-meritocracy">Read here</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Economic Policy Institute on Pay Inequality and Performance Reviews:</strong> <a href="https://www.epi.org/">Read here</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kotaku’s Analysis of Workplace Dynamics in MMORPGs:</strong> <a href="https://www.kotaku.com/">Read here</a>.</p></li></ul><p>The future of authority in the workplace lies in breaking free from outdated hierarchies and embracing systems that value every individual’s unique contributions. What would a meritocratic workplace look like for you? </p>
