<section name="6d9e" class="section section--body section--first section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure name="3d5c" id="3d5c" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*RoEF_10vuG1cz2IIm3Umxw.jpeg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-is-featured="true" alt="What’s up with the American Dream?" src="/assets/medium/2024-05-22-tiktok-and-the-us-government-a-battle-over-narrative/1-RoEF_10vuG1cz2IIm3Umxw-784d8a20.jpeg"></figure><p name="f9e4" id="f9e4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The ongoing efforts by the US government to ban TikTok have often been framed as a matter of national security, with a particular emphasis on privacy and data concerns. However, a closer examination reveals that the real issue at stake is narrative control. While privacy and data security are undoubtedly important, they are not the primary drivers behind the push to restrict TikTok. Instead, the US intelligence community’s primary concern is the platform’s ability to challenge and subvert narratives that are critical to US interests.</p><h4 name="1561" id="1561" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">National Security or Narrative Security?</h4><p name="a560" id="a560" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The arguments supporting the TikTok ban largely come from the US intelligence community, which has consistently cited national security risks. They argue that TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, could potentially be used by the Chinese government to collect data on US citizens or influence public opinion. However, this stance appears somewhat disingenuous when considering the broader context of data privacy in the United States.</p><p name="6b8b" id="6b8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The US lacks a comprehensive federal privacy framework, leaving citizens’ data largely unprotected and readily available for purchase from data brokers. This means that any foreign or domestic entity with sufficient resources can access vast amounts of personal information. Therefore, the push to ban TikTok under the guise of protecting privacy seems misplaced when there is little privacy to protect in the first place.</p><h4 name="c2ec" id="c2ec" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Real Threat: Narrative Control</h4><p name="c469" id="c469" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The more plausible explanation for the TikTok ban lies in the realm of narrative control. TikTok has become a powerful platform for disseminating information and shaping public discourse, often in ways that diverge from US government narratives. This is particularly evident in its coverage of sensitive issues such as the conflict in Gaza, climate change, food security, and criticisms of capitalism.</p><p name="d313" id="d313" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, during the recent conflicts in Gaza, TikTok provided a platform for voices that were often marginalized or excluded from mainstream media. This enabled a more diverse range of perspectives to reach a global audience, challenging the narratives promoted by US interests. Similarly, on issues like climate change and food security, TikTok has facilitated the spread of grassroots movements and alternative viewpoints that question the status quo.</p><h4 name="3288" id="3288" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Power of the American Dream</h4><p name="39c7" id="39c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To understand the significance of narrative control, one need only look at the enduring power of the “American Dream.” For over a century, this narrative has attracted immigrants and fostered national pride by promising that anyone can achieve success through hard work and determination. The American Dream has been a cornerstone of US cultural and political identity, shaping perceptions both domestically and internationally.</p><p name="a621" id="a621" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, TikTok is now challenging this narrative. Through its vast and diverse user base, the platform is exposing the harsh realities and systemic inequalities that many face in pursuit of the American Dream. Stories of economic hardship, social injustice, and political disillusionment are gaining traction, painting a more complex and often less flattering picture of American life. This shift in narrative threatens to undermine the idealized vision of the United States that has been carefully cultivated over generations.</p><h4 name="5e87" id="5e87" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Inevitability of Resistance</h4><p name="2d91" id="2d91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Despite the US government’s efforts, banning TikTok is likely to be an uphill battle. Legal challenges will undoubtedly arise, questioning the constitutionality of such a ban. Additionally, the court of public opinion is a formidable force. TikTok’s immense popularity, particularly among younger generations, means that any attempts to restrict its use will face significant backlash.</p><p name="cd57" id="cd57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Furthermore, the interconnected nature of global digital platforms makes it difficult to completely eliminate access to TikTok. Even if the app were banned in the US, users could find ways to circumvent restrictions through VPNs or other means. The desire for free expression and access to diverse viewpoints is likely to prevail over government-imposed limitations.</p><h4 name="9a94" id="9a94" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Reflecting on the Future</h4><p name="5165" id="5165" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As we move forward, it is worth reflecting on the impact TikTok is having on the notion of the American Dream. Is the platform merely exposing the American Dream as an unattainable ideal, or is it helping to redefine it for a new generation? The answer to this question will have profound implications for the future of US society and its role on the global stage.</p><p name="23b1" id="23b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In conclusion, the US government’s desire to ban TikTok is not primarily about privacy or data security. It is about controlling the narratives that shape public perception and influence national identity. As TikTok continues to democratize information and challenge established narratives, it represents a substantial threat to those who seek to maintain control over the stories that define us.</p></div></div></section>
