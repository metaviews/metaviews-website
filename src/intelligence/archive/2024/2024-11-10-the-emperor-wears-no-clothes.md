Not just a few cats — millions of them. Each cat has its own ideas, desires, and clever ways of doing exactly what it wants while appearing to follow rules. Now imagine thinking you could control all these cats through pure force and fear.</p><p name="01a4" id="01a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sounds absurd, right? Yet this is exactly what authoritarian regimes try to do with humans, who are considerably more creative than cats when it comes to resistance.</p><h4 name="2421" id="2421" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Great Authoritarian Fantasy</h4><p name="40a6" id="40a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Every authoritarian rises to power selling the same dream: perfect order, absolute efficiency, trains running on time, and streets free of crime. It’s a seductive sales pitch. Who doesn’t want a perfectly organized society?</p><p name="ae29" id="ae29" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s just one tiny problem: it’s about as realistic as trying to stop the ocean’s waves by yelling at them.</p><figure name="48fe" id="48fe" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*PYYI-ktu3uX_B57bC2y3ZQ.png" data-width="1024" data-height="1024" alt="A person yelling at a wave to no effect" src="/assets/medium/2024-11-10-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes/1-PYYI-ktu3uX_B57bC2y3ZQ-cab87eec.png"></figure><p name="2b81" id="2b81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Here’s the thing about humans: we’re messy, creative, and surprisingly stubborn. Tell someone they absolutely cannot do something, and suddenly that’s all they can think about doing. Psychology researchers have known this for years — we respond way better to carrots than sticks.</p><p name="b435" id="b435" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Remember that time you tried to force yourself to follow a super strict diet? How did that work out? Now imagine trying to force an entire country to follow thousands of strict rules. It’s diet failure on a national scale.</p><h4 name="fbd5" id="fbd5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Internet as Double-Edged Sword in the Age of Authoritarianism</h4><p name="afa6" id="afa6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Remember when we thought the internet would automatically mean the end of authoritarianism? Those were adorably naïve days. The reality turned out more complicated — like giving both the resistance and the empire better weapons.</p><h4 name="58e8" id="58e8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">How The Internet Breaks Authoritarian Control</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="70b7" id="70b7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">During Iran’s 2022 protests, teenagers with phones became more powerful than government censors. Every act of repression became a viral video.</li><li name="c4a2" id="c4a2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">When Shanghai went into harsh lockdown in 2022, residents shared their struggles through WeChat and Weibo faster than censors could delete them. They even invented creative code words to bypass automatic filters.</li><li name="f415" id="f415" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Russians use VPNs so much to bypass state media control that they’ve basically become a national hobby.</li><li name="2780" id="2780" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">In Belarus, Telegram channels coordinated massive protests that scared Europe’s “last dictator” so badly he had to call in help from Russia.</li></ul><h4 name="e2be" id="e2be" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">But Wait, There’s a Plot Twist</h4><p name="7269" id="7269" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Here’s where it gets messy. Authoritarian regimes learned they could fight fire with fire:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="1173" id="1173" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">They discovered flooding social media with nonsense works better than censoring truth</li><li name="171d" id="171d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">They recognize confused people are easier to control than informed ones.</li><li name="159a" id="159a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">They recognize that social media bubbles can actually help separate people.</li><li name="4494" id="4494" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">They learned to weaponize algorithms against their own people.</li></ul><p name="a174" id="a174" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">It’s like they took the tools of freedom and turned them into sophisticated chaos machines. Why ban information when you can just make people doubt everything?</p><p name="5bb0" id="5bb0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here’s the thing: even this strategy is failing. Why? Because:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="9fca" id="9fca" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Young people are getting remarkably good at spotting fake news.</li><li name="1f21" id="1f21" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Every government lie that gets exposed damages credibility exponentially.</li><li name="5d05" id="5d05" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">You can’t maintain economic growth when your population doesn’t trust any information.</li><li name="b0e4" id="b0e4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The false narratives fall apart when your toilet paper supply runs out.</li></ol><h3 name="a176" id="a176" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">The Productivity Problem</h3><p name="3622" id="3622" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Here’s where it gets really interesting. Authoritarian regimes promise efficiency, but they’re actually terrible at getting things done. Why? Because they create societies where:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="a8ae" id="a8ae" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Everyone is afraid to report problems.</li><li name="7c83" id="7c83" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Innovation is dangerous. What if your new idea makes the boss look bad?</li><li name="b8de" id="b8de" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The best and brightest often flee.</li><li name="f066" id="f066" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Resources go to an insatiable desire to control (which can never actually be achieved) rather than production.</li></ul><p name="06f1" id="06f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">It’s like trying to run a restaurant where all the staff are terrified of admitting they dropped a plate. Pretty soon, you’re serving food off the floor because nobody dares mention you need new plates.</p><h4 name="e9b4" id="e9b4" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Greatest Hits of Failed Authoritarian Policies</h4><p name="252a" id="252a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Let’s look at some real-world examples of authoritarian “brilliance” in action:</p><h4 name="0802" id="0802" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Great Leap Backward</h4><p name="1bd4" id="1bd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">China’s Great Leap Forward included the brilliant idea of having peasants melt down their cooking pots to increase steel production. The result? Lots of useless metal lumps and a whole lot of people who couldn’t cook food. Turns out, you can’t actually make industrial steel in your backyard. Who knew?</p><h4 name="8b3e" id="8b3e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Case of the Vanishing Sparrows</h4><p name="1a6b" id="1a6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Mao decided sparrows were eating too much grain and ordered them eliminated. Turns out, sparrows also eat insects. Without sparrows, insects ate even more grain. It’s almost like ecosystems are complex or something.</p><h4 name="0c21" id="0c21" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Soviet Five-Year Plans Greatest Hits</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="ae0d" id="ae0d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">The shoe factory that only made left shoes to exceed quota.</li><li name="f46f" id="f46f" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The nail factory that made giant, unusable nails because they were measured by weight.</li><li name="8074" id="8074" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The glass factory that made chandeliers so heavy they collapsed ceilings, because weight meant success.</li></ul><h4 name="b4eb" id="b4eb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Modern Classics</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="4928" id="4928" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">Venezuela’s attempt to fight inflation by making it illegal to report inflation rates.</li><li name="9b34" id="9b34" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">North Korea’s solution to food shortages: promoting a two-meals-a-day campaign as “healthier”.</li><li name="189a" id="189a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Turkmenistan’s COVID strategy of banning the word “coronavirus”.</li><li name="b0f7" id="b0f7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Belarus claiming a 80% election victory so absurd it sparked nationwide protests.</li></ul><h4 name="2cf6" id="2cf6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Why These Failures Happen</h4><p name="7272" id="7272" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The pattern is always the same:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="6974" id="6974" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Leader makes decision based on ideology rather than reality</li><li name="76c7" id="76c7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Nobody dares point out obvious problems</li><li name="03c8" id="03c8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Implementation becomes a disaster</li><li name="b535" id="b535" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Everyone pretends everything is fine</li><li name="ab7b" id="ab7b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Reality becomes impossible to ignore</li><li name="4b76" id="4b76" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Government blames “saboteurs” or “foreign influences”</li><li name="563a" id="563a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Repeat with new bad idea</li></ol><h4 name="ee56" id="ee56" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">The Soviet Story: Or Why You Can’t Force Prosperity</h4><p name="cd82" id="cd82" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The Soviet Union tried for decades to prove authoritarianism could outperform democracy. They had:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="5dd3" id="5dd3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Complete control</li><li name="9c7c" id="9c7c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Brilliant scientists and engineers</li><li name="75e2" id="75e2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Vast natural resources</li><li name="4e21" id="4e21" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">A population willing to sacrifice</li></ul><p name="bdda" id="bdda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Yet they couldn’t keep grocery stores stocked with basic items. Their cars became international jokes. By the 1980s, they were secretly buying grain from their capitalist “enemies” just to feed their people.</p><h4 name="f0ac" id="f0ac" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The Modern Myth</h4><p name="1a73" id="1a73" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h4">“But what about [insert current authoritarian regime]?” you might ask. Look closer. The successful ones all had to adopt reforms. The ones that didn’t? They’re not exactly topping quality-of-life rankings.</p><p name="b393" id="b393" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">North Korea has maximum control and minimum prosperity. China’s economic miracle started when they loosened control. It’s almost like giving people some freedom helps them be more productive.</p><h4 name="4cb7" id="4cb7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Why Authoritarians Need Propaganda</h4><p name="1f69" id="1f69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">If authoritarianism worked as advertised, it wouldn’t need massive propaganda machines. You don’t need to convince people gravity exists — they can see it working. But you do need to convince them the emperor’s new clothes are fabulous when he’s clearly naked.</p><p name="2efe" id="2efe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is why authoritarian states invest so heavily in controlling narratives. They’re not selling reality — they’re selling an increasingly expensive illusion.</p><h4 name="e962" id="e962" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">TL;DR</h4><p name="7eca" id="7eca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Authoritarianism isn’t just morally wrong — it’s incompetent. It’s the political equivalent of trying to fix a computer by hitting it with a hammer. It promises perfect order and delivers dysfunction. It promises efficiency and creates waste. It promises strength and delivers fragility.</p><p name="0979" id="0979" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The next time you hear someone praising authoritarian “efficiency,” remember: they’re not describing reality. They’re falling for the oldest political marketing scam in history. The emperor isn’t wearing any clothes — and his tailor is charging a fortune for nothing.</p><h4 name="de03" id="de03" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">What Now?</h4><p name="7ac6" id="7ac6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The best defense against authoritarianism isn’t just moral outrage — it’s pointing out how hilariously bad it is at its job. Dictators can handle being called evil. They can’t handle being called incompetent.</p><p name="7fab" id="7fab" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So the next time you encounter authoritarian ideas, don’t just get angry. Laugh. Because trying to control millions of human beings through pure force isn’t just wrong — it’s ridiculous. It’s like trying to nail jello to a wall while the jello is posting memes about you.</p><figure name="affe" id="affe" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*TZ9gmhW9-Hs9vT17nkW9NQ.png" data-width="1024" data-height="1024" alt="Trump is a clown" src="/assets/medium/2024-11-10-the-emperor-wears-no-clothes/1-TZ9gmhW9-Hs9vT17nkW9NQ-d436dcbe.png"></figure></div></div></section>
