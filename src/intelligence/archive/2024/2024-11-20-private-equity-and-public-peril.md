The fascist rhetoric of figures like Donald Trump didn’t emerge in a vacuum. It’s the fruit of a system where private equity and corporate consolidation have cultivated a culture of control, silencing dissent, and disempowering workers.</p><h3>The Corporate Model as a Dictatorship</h3><p>At their core, corporations function as authoritarian regimes. Decision-making is reserved for a narrow group of shareholders, who often remain detached from the operational realities of the business. Workers, the lifeblood of any organization, have little to no say in the policies that govern their livelihoods. The corporate structure doesn’t just tolerate dissent; it actively stamps it out.</p><p>Private equity firms, in particular, epitomize this model. By acquiring and consolidating businesses, they strip them for parts, maximize short-term profits, and leave behind a trail of gutted industries and devastated communities. Recent investigations, like ProPublica’s exposé on private equity’s role in the decline of nursing homes, underscore the human cost of this financial engineering.</p><h3>From Boardrooms to Ballot Boxes</h3><p>The rise of Trump’s authoritarian populism can be directly tied to this economic concentration. Wealth has been funneled upwards for decades, creating an elite class that wields disproportionate power over political and economic systems. According to a 2023 study by the Economic Policy Institute, CEO pay has skyrocketed by over 1,200% since 1978, while typical worker compensation has barely budged.</p><p>This disparity feeds into a sense of disenfranchisement, making many Americans susceptible to the blame-shifting rhetoric of authoritarian leaders. Trump’s promise to "drain the swamp" resonated because it tapped into widespread frustration with an economic system designed to benefit the few at the expense of the many. Yet his administration, dominated by corporate interests, only deepened this imbalance.</p><h3>Resisting Corporate Control: Lessons from the IBEW and Longshoremen</h3><p>The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) offer powerful counterexamples to the corporate consolidation of power. Both unions have a long history of successful collective bargaining, proving that organized labor can resist and even reverse the authoritarian tendencies of corporate America.</p><p>The IBEW, representing electrical workers across industries, has consistently secured contracts that not only ensure fair wages but also protect worker safety and autonomy. Their ability to negotiate from a position of collective strength demonstrates how organized labor can act as a democratic counterforce within an otherwise authoritarian corporate framework.</p><p>Similarly, the ILWU has a storied history of leveraging its power to protect workers and communities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, longshoremen played a critical role in keeping supply chains running while ensuring safety measures were in place. Their contracts emphasize worker control over conditions on the docks, a stark contrast to the top-down management style of most corporations.</p><p>These successes highlight a key truth: when workers unite, they can challenge even the most entrenched corporate power structures.</p><h3>Corporate Fascism and Pop Culture</h3><p>Movies like <em>RoboCop</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> have become iconic for their portrayal of corporations as dystopian overlords. In <em>RoboCop</em>, the omnipresent Omni Consumer Products (OCP) doesn’t just manufacture goods—it runs Detroit’s police force, privatizing public safety in a way that prioritizes profits over people. The film’s chilling vision of corporate authoritarianism is a critique of privatization and corporate overreach, themes that feel increasingly relevant in today's world.</p><p><em>Blade Runner</em> takes this a step further, presenting a future where the Tyrell Corporation wields god-like power, creating artificial life while remaining unaccountable to any external authority. The film explores how technology, when monopolized by corporate entities, can exacerbate existing inequalities and dehumanize labor. It’s a stark warning about the dangers of technological advancements controlled by profit-driven interests.</p><h4><strong>Television’s Take on Corporate Authoritarianism</strong></h4><p>On the small screen, shows like <em>Succession</em> and <em>Severance</em> dissect the human toll of corporate dominance. <em>Succession</em> offers a behind-the-scenes look at a fictional media empire, portraying the Roy family’s Machiavellian power struggles. Though it focuses on the elite, the show highlights how corporate greed and consolidation distort public discourse, influence politics, and undermine democratic processes.</p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Severance</em> explores a more intimate form of control. In this series, workers at the fictional Lumon Industries undergo a procedure that separates their work and personal lives. The result is a chilling depiction of corporate dominance over the individual, stripping workers of autonomy and blurring the line between their humanity and their labor.</p><h4><strong>Why Pop Culture Matters</strong></h4><p>These portrayals are more than entertainment; they help shape public perception of corporate power. By dramatizing the consequences of unchecked capitalism, pop culture provides accessible critiques that resonate across socioeconomic divides. It also empowers audiences to question the systems they live under, making abstract concepts like wealth concentration and labor exploitation tangible and urgent.</p><p>Pop culture, in essence, serves as both a warning and a call to action. It reminds us that the struggle against corporate authoritarianism is not confined to boardrooms or picket lines—it’s a cultural fight as well. As audiences, we absorb these stories and, in doing so, become more attuned to the power dynamics that shape our world.</p><h3>An Opportunity for Change</h3><p>The rise of authoritarianism in America is not merely a political phenomenon; it is deeply rooted in economic systems that prioritize profit over people. But resistance is not futile. Labor unions like the IBEW and ILWU show that organized, collective action can successfully challenge corporate overreach and offer a blueprint for a more democratic workplace.</p><p>If we are to counter the creeping tide of authoritarianism, we must confront its economic roots. Reimagining authority means dismantling corporate hierarchies and redistributing power to workers and communities.</p><h3>Further Reading</h3><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2024/09/30/price-gouging-and-other-dirty-tricks-kroger-albertsons-merger/">The Kroger-Albertsons Merger</a>:</strong> A recent case study in corporate consolidation, highlighting private equity’s impact on our food supply.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Economic Policy Institute’s CEO Pay Report (2023):</strong> <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2023/">Read here</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>ProPublica’s Investigation on Private Equity in Healthcare:</strong> <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/private-equity-nursing-homes">Read here</a>.</p></li></ul>
