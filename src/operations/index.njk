<h1>Operations</h1>

<p>
  Operations is where Metaviews documents how the work is done: principles,
  process, and practical infrastructure. This section is intentionally
  lightweight in v1.

<ul>
  <li><a href="/about/">About</a></li>
  <li><a href="/start/">Start</a></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>
  If there are specific operations pages you want to feature here, we can add a
  short curated list once we see what’s in <code>src/operations/</code>.
