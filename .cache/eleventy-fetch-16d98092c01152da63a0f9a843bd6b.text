The conversation opens with a critical examination of recent announcements from the Trump administration regarding AI investments and the illusion of progress that often accompanies such news. Chris Hood shares insights from his upcoming book, revealing a significant seven-year gap between public perception of AI capabilities and their actual technological advancements. The dialogue emphasizes that while AI holds potential, many of its touted achievements remain speculative, and the reality often lags behind the hype. As the discussion progresses, both Jesse and Chris explore the potential consequences of this disconnect, including a possible “AI bubble” that may burst as consumers and investors realize the limitations of current AI technologies. This notion is further compounded by the increasing awareness among consumers about the difference between marketing hype and actual product capability, leading to skepticism about the future of AI investments and innovations.</p><p>The discussion takes a turn towards the philosophical, as Chris Hood proposes that the current discourse around AI reflects a broader ideological belief system—equating AI with infallibility. This belief is scrutinized through various examples, from the simplistic use of AI in everyday applications to the more complex implications of relying on technology to address non-existent problems. Hood argues that the marketing strategies employed by tech companies promote a narrative that positions AI as a panacea for all issues, neglecting the reality that many solutions do not require AI. Through anecdotes and critical analysis, the conversation reveals how this ideology can lead to misguided expectations, potentially undermining genuine advancements in technology and critical thinking skills.</p><p>As the episode draws to a close, Jesse and Chris pivot to the role of gaming in fostering critical thinking and emotional intelligence.

The conversation underscores the importance of maintaining a customer-first approach in technological development, advocating for a model where technology serves real consumer needs rather than the whims of corporate hype.

Fingrut describes the Media Collective as a vibrant social network that convened in person to collaborate on creative projects, often infused with political undertones. The conversation reveals how the collective fostered a sense of community among diverse individuals who were passionate about media-making and social change, utilizing discussions and monthly meetings to share ideas and launch various initiatives. Hirsh emphasizes the cultural significance of the collective during a period marked by the rise of the internet and alternative media, suggesting that it represented a crucial turning point in how communities engaged with media production.</p><p>Delving deeper into the socio-political context of their experiences, the hosts discuss how the Media Collective intersected with movements like Reclaim the Streets, which sought to reclaim public space through creative protests. Fingrut recalls the playful yet poignant tactics employed, such as street theater and spontaneous gatherings, which contrasted sharply with conventional forms of activism. The dialogue highlights the necessity of physical presence and community organizing, especially when juxtaposed against the backdrop of today's digital landscape, where online activism often overshadows physical mobilization. As they navigate through the significance of these grassroots movements, both Hirsh and Fingrut underscore a collective yearning for a return to tangible, community-driven activism in the face of modern challenges.</p><p>The episode culminates with a discussion on the future of activism and the role of media in shaping public discourse. The two ponder the implications of the current political climate, particularly as it relates to the rise of authoritarianism and the erosion of public spaces.

Fingrut describes the Media Collective as a vibrant social network that convened in person to collaborate on creative projects, often infused with political undertones. The conversation reveals how the collective fostered a sense of community among diverse individuals who were passionate about media-making and social change, utilizing discussions and monthly meetings to share ideas and launch various initiatives. Hirsh emphasizes the cultural significance of the collective during a period marked by the rise of the internet and alternative media, suggesting that it represented a crucial turning point in how communities engaged with media production.</p><p>Delving deeper into the socio-political context of their experiences, the hosts discuss how the Media Collective intersected with movements like Reclaim the Streets, which sought to reclaim public space through creative protests. Fingrut recalls the playful yet poignant tactics employed, such as street theater and spontaneous gatherings, which contrasted sharply with conventional forms of activism. The dialogue highlights the necessity of physical presence and community organizing, especially when juxtaposed against the backdrop of today's digital landscape, where online activism often overshadows physical mobilization. As they navigate through the significance of these grassroots movements, both Hirsh and Fingrut underscore a collective yearning for a return to tangible, community-driven activism in the face of modern challenges.</p><p>The episode culminates with a discussion on the future of activism and the role of media in shaping public discourse. The two ponder the implications of the current political climate, particularly as it relates to the rise of authoritarianism and the erosion of public spaces. They reflect on the lessons learned from the Media Collective and how those principles can inform contemporary movements seeking to reclaim agency in a world increasingly dominated by corporate interests. Hirsh and Fingrut's dialogue serves as a poignant reminder of the power of collective action, the importance of community, and the ongoing struggle for a more just and equitable society, urging listeners to reconsider their roles within these narratives of resistance and resilience.</p>]]></content:encoded><link><![CDATA[https://news.metaviews.ca/episode/19-dont-get-caught-the-rise-and-fall-of-media-collective]]></link><guid isPermaLink="false">3af4a4ff-4709-4764-94fb-d61cfced2775</guid><itunes:image href="https://artwork.captivate.fm/928bbf60-187e-4b30-8cbc-76a7cb42b873/pBheRQEgi7fNtiWR7uhGz_pF.jpg"/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 20:00:00 -0400</pubDate><enclosure url="https://podcasts.captivate.fm/media/74086ae8-03a1-40a4-af2b-d67ad897880f/DavidFingrut-Jan13-25.mp3" length="152283840" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:duration>01:03:27</itunes:duration><itunes:explicit>true</itunes:explicit><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType><itunes:season>2</itunes:season><itunes:episode>19</itunes:episode><itunes:season>2</itunes:season><podcast:episode>19</podcast:episode><podcast:season>2</podcast:season><podcast:transcript url="https://transcripts.captivate.fm/transcript/c11fe54e-b73e-4861-99b5-fc47f97fba8b/transcript.json" type="application/json"/><podcast:transcript url="https://transcripts.captivate.fm/transcript/c11fe54e-b73e-4861-99b5-fc47f97fba8b/transcript.srt" type="application/srt" rel="captions"/><podcast:transcript url="https://transcripts.captivate.fm/transcript/c11fe54e-b73e-4861-99b5-fc47f97fba8b/index.html" type="text/html"/><podcast:alternateEnclosure type="video/youtube" title="19: Don&apos;t Get Caught: The Rise and Fall of The Toronto Media Collective"><podcast:source uri="https://youtu.be/38u1Pf7oQOY"/></podcast:alternateEnclosure></item><item><title>The Power of Storytelling: How Roni Robbins Honors Her Grandfather&apos;s Legacy</title><itunes:title>The Power of Storytelling: How Roni Robbins Honors Her Grandfather&apos;s Legacy</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>Roni Robbins, an award-winning author and seasoned journalist, joins Jesse Hirsh on Metaviews to discuss her novel, "Hands of Gold," which delves into her family's remarkable history and the enduring themes of survival and resilience.

Just as we would argue that individuals deserve privacy while corporations do not, perhaps there is a similar analogy here. That legislators deserver reasonable amounts of privacy, whereas the government as an organization does not.

James would argue that the construction of policies deserves secrecy, whereas the voting or passage of them does not. He also points out that before the secret ballot, people were often subject to political violence due to how they voted.

While James focuses on legislative transparency, I can’t help but see a similar lesson when it comes to the digital world and in particular algorithms.

Perhaps there is need for greater nuance there as well.</itunes:summary></item><item><title>Is there such a thing as Responsible Innovation?</title><itunes:title>Is there such a thing as Responsible Innovation?</itunes:title><description><![CDATA[<p>A Metaviews salon from January 2021 on the topic of responsible innovation.
