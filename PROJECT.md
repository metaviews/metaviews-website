# Metaviews.ca — Project Brief

## Purpose

Metaviews.ca is the public home of Metaviews: a long‑running intelligence and media practice that publishes durable analysis, maintains a historical archive, and produces selected programming. The site prioritizes continuity, memory, and context over novelty or optimization.

It exists to make decades of work legible, accessible, and linkable — not to chase audiences or platforms.

## Primary audiences

* Readers encountering Metaviews through writing, talks, or citations who want authoritative context
* Long‑time readers seeking a stable archive
* Listeners looking for Metaviews podcast episodes and related material
* Collaborators, institutions, and partners assessing Metaviews’ scope and credibility

## Content types

**Intelligence**

* Essays, briefs, notes, and analysis
* Includes a deep historical archive (2008–present)
* Treated as durable reference material, not posts or news

**Programming**

* Podcasts and recorded conversations produced by Metaviews
* Currently centered on the Metaviews podcast
* Time‑bound, but contextualized by adjacent intelligence

**Operations**

* Pages explaining how Metaviews works
* Includes process notes, principles, and organizational material
* Secondary to intelligence and programming

**About / Start**

* Lightweight onboarding and identity pages
* Explains what Metaviews is, where it came from, and how to engage

## v1 information architecture

* Home: routing page to Intelligence, Programming, and Operations
* /intelligence/
* /intelligence/archive/
* /intelligence/tags/
* /programming/
* /programming/podcasts/metaviews/
* /about/
* /start/

## Design and technical principles

* Favor explicit structure over clever abstractions
* Prefer stability and legibility over visual polish
* Make collections and routes intentional, not accidental
* Avoid premature taxonomy, funnels, or thematic overlays

## Non‑goals (for now)

* No redesign or brand overhaul
* No heavy thematic navigation beyond tags
* No optimization for growth, SEO, or conversion
* No assumption that readers arrive sequentially or linearly

This file is the anchor for decisions about structure, scope, and priorities. When in doubt, default to durability, clarity, and historical continuity.
